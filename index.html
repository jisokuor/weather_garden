            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Considering the weather data provided, I'll offer advice on watering, setting shades, what to plant today, and other useful hints and tips.

**Watering:**
Given the pleasant temperature of 22.82°C and humidity level of 64%, it's an ideal day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as overwatering can be detrimental. If you have containers or pots, consider using a drip irrigation system or soaker hose to conserve water.

**Shading:**
With only few clouds in the sky and a moderate wind speed of 3.41 m/s, it's not necessary to set up shades for your plants today. However, if you have sensitive plants or those that prefer partial shade, consider using a sheer curtain or a trellis with a mesh material to filter out direct sunlight.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant various flowers, herbs, and vegetables in Porvoo's climate. Today, I recommend planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas. These plants thrive in the moderate temperatures and can tolerate some cloud cover. You can also consider planting annuals like marigolds, zinnias, or cosmos for a pop of color.

**Other Tips:**

* Mulch your soil to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
* Fertilize your plants with a balanced fertilizer, as the warm weather will encourage growth.
* Keep an eye on your plants' pest management. Aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites might be active during this time.
* Deadhead spent flowers to promote healthy plant growth and encourage more blooms.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving and beautiful garden in Porvoo. Happy gardening!</p>
