Considering today's weather, I recommend planting:<br><br>1. Cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas.<br>2. Flowers like pansies, violas, or sweet peas that thrive in the cooler temperatures.<br>3. Herbs like mint, thyme, or oregano that can tolerate partial shade.<br><br>**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**<br><br>1. **Soil preparation:** As the soil is still slightly cool from the morning dew, it's an ideal time to prepare your garden beds for planting. Remove any debris, and mix in some compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and fertility.<br>2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, and snails that might be active during this time of year. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or copper tape to protect your plants.<br>3. **Garden maintenance:** Take advantage of the clear weather to tidy up your garden beds, prune any dead foliage, and remove any weeds.<br><br>Remember to dress warmly and wear comfortable shoes as you tend to your garden today!</p>
