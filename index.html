<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on the current weather forecast.<br><br>**Watering:** With a temperature of 13.47°C (12.99°C felt) and humidity at 81%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as the scattered clouds might not provide consistent sunlight. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water, depending on the type of plants you have.<br><br>**Shade:** With the sun shining brightly (albeit with some scattered clouds), it's a good idea to provide shade for your plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use shade cloth or even create a DIY shade using a trellis and some string lights.<br><br>**Planting:** Today is an excellent day to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. The soil should be still relatively cool, which will help prevent shocking the plants. Make sure to choose varieties that are suitable for your region's climate (Finland can get quite chilly in the evenings).<br><br>**Other Tips:**<br><br>* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (1.9 m/s) to create a sense of air movement around your plants. This can help with pollination and reduce fungal diseases.<br>* Keep an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases, as the humidity might encourage their growth.<br>* If you have any sensitive plants that are prone to sunburn, consider using a shade cloth or a DIY shade structure.<br><br>**Additional Tip:** As it's still early in the growing season, make sure to harden off your seedlings before transplanting them outside. This will help them adjust to the outdoor conditions and reduce shock.<br><br>That's all for today! I hope you found these expert gardening tips and recommendations helpful. Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
