<h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</3>
<p>What a lovely day it is in Porvoo, Finland! With a clear sky and moderate temperatures, today's gardening conditions are perfect for some outdoor activities. Here are my expert tips and recommendations based on the weather data:<br><br>**Watering:** Given the high humidity of 92%, you might want to hold off on watering your plants until later this afternoon when the sun starts to shine more intensely. This will help prevent fungal diseases from developing.<br><br>**Shades:** Since it's a relatively cool day (13.06Â°C), you can leave your shading structures, like row covers or shade cloths, off for now. However, if you have sensitive plants that prefer partial shade, consider installing temporary shades to protect them from the direct sunlight.<br><br>**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo! The soil is still cool, which makes it ideal for planting vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and peas. You can also start sowing annuals like marigolds, zinnias, or sunflowers. Make sure to choose varieties that are suitable for the local climate.<br><br>**Gardening tips:**<br><br>1. **Soil preparation:** Since the soil is still a bit cool, you might want to wait until it warms up before planting warm-season crops.<br>2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids and other pests that thrive in humid conditions. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.<br>3. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the mild weather to prune your plants, like fruit trees or shrubs. This will help promote healthy growth and prevent overgrowth.<br>4. **Companion planting:** Pair plants that have similar growing requirements, such as tomatoes and basil, to create a more balanced ecosystem.<br><br>**Additional hints:**<br><br>1. **Check the forecast:** Keep an eye on the weather forecast for the next few days, as it looks like things might get warmer and sunnier.<br>2. **Protect your plants from wind:** Although the wind speed is relatively low (1.81 m/s), it's still a good idea to provide support structures or windbreaks for your taller plants.<br><br>Enjoy your gardening today in Porvoo!</p>
