            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Considering the weather data and the month of May, here's what I suggest:

**Watering:** With a humidity level of 96%, it's essential to ensure your plants are not overwatered. Water them thoroughly in the morning, but make sure the soil is dry enough by mid-afternoon to avoid fungal diseases. Keep an eye on the weather forecast and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.

**Shading:** Scattered clouds can still allow for significant sunlight, so consider setting up shades or using plants with natural shading properties like ferns or hostas to protect your more sensitive plants from intense sun rays.

**What to Plant Today:**

May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo. Take advantage of the mild temperatures (up to 21.35Â°C) and scattered clouds by planting:

* Early summer flowers like marigolds, zinnias, or cosmos
* Vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, or radishes
* Herbs like basil, mint, or thyme

**Additional Hints and Tips:**

* Make the most of the gentle breeze (3.02 m/s) by planting wind-resistant species like lavender or rosemary.
* Prune your plants to maintain their shape and promote healthy growth.
* Keep an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases, and take action promptly if you notice anything unusual.

By following these expert gardening tips, you'll be well on your way to a thriving and beautiful garden in Porvoo. Happy gardening!</p>
