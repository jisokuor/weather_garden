            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">Dear gardener! As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Temperature:** With a temperature of 12.37Â°C (May is an excellent time to plant, as the soil has warmed up nicely), it's perfect for most plants to thrive.

**Weather conditions:** Few clouds mean plenty of sunlight, which will help your plants grow and photosynthesize efficiently.

**Wind speed:** A gentle breeze of 1.48 m/s won't cause any significant damage or discomfort to your plants.

**Humidity:** With a relative humidity of 89%, it's essential to ensure good air circulation around your plants to prevent moisture-related issues like fungal diseases.

Now, let's get to the actionable advice!

**Watering:**

* Water your plants thoroughly in the morning, as the soil has had time to absorb most of the water overnight.
* Check the soil moisture by inserting a finger into the top 2-3 inches. If it feels dry, it's time for another round of watering.

**Shading:**

* Since there are few clouds, your plants won't need any shading. However, if you have plants that prefer partial shade (like ferns or impatiens), consider providing some gentle filtering using a shade cloth or a trellis with a canopy.

**What to plant today:**

* With the favorable weather conditions, May is an excellent time to plant:
	+ Cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale.
	+ Root vegetables like carrots, beets, and potatoes.
	+ Perennials like hostas, daylilies, and black-eyed susans.

**Other useful hints:**

* Make sure to mulch around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Organic materials like straw or bark chips work well.
* Prune any dead or damaged foliage from your plants to promote healthy growth and prevent disease spread.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails, which are more active in this type of weather.

By following these expert gardening tips, you'll be on track to enjoy a bountiful harvest and a beautiful garden throughout the year!</p>
