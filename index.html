            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:** With a temperature of 25.14°C (77°F) and humidity at 44%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to water them thoroughly, but not excessively, as the soil may still be drying out from spring thaw. Check the soil moisture by inserting your finger into the soil up to the knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time for a drink!

**Shades:** With only few clouds in the sky, you won't need to worry about providing shades for your plants today. However, if you have plants that require filtered sunlight or complete shade, now is a great time to provide those.

**Planting:** May is an excellent month to plant many types of flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo. Today's mild weather makes it perfect for planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas. You can also start sowing seeds for warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants.

**Other tips:**

* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (wind speed 3.41 m/s or 7.6 mph) to help pollinate your plants.
* With a visibility of 10 km (10000 meters), you can enjoy the beautiful scenery while tending to your garden.
* Keep an eye out for any pests or diseases that might be taking advantage of the warm weather.

**Additional advice:** As we head into the summer months, it's essential to keep in mind the long days and potential heatwaves. Make sure to provide adequate shading for your plants, especially those that prefer partial shade or complete shade. Also, don't forget to mulch and compost regularly to maintain soil health and retain moisture.

Now, go ahead and get gardening!</p>
