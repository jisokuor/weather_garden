<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather data.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>Given the expected high temperature of 18.99°C and the moderate humidity level of 73%, it's essential to water your plants thoroughly this morning. The soil might dry out quickly due to the warm conditions, so make sure to give them a good soaking. You can also consider using drip irrigation or soaker hoses to reduce evaporation and runoff.<br><br>**Shading:**<br>With the sun expected to shine brightly, providing some shading for your plants will be beneficial. You can use row covers, shade cloth, or even newspaper to block out direct sunlight and prevent scorching. This is especially important for sensitive plants like lettuce, spinach, and herbs.<br><br>**Planting:**<br>May 17th in Porvoo marks the perfect time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. These plants thrive in temperatures above 15°C (59°F), making today an ideal day for sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings. You can also start sowing beans, cucumbers, and squash.<br><br>**Additional Tips:**<br><br>1. **Monitor the wind:** Although the wind speed is relatively low, it's still a good idea to secure any loose outdoor plants or containers to prevent them from getting blown away.<br>2. **Maintain soil health:** With the warm weather approaching, make sure your soil is well-draining and has adequate organic matter. This will help prevent waterlogging and support healthy root growth.<br>3. **Check for pests:** The warmer temperatures might attract unwanted visitors like aphids, whiteflies, or caterpillars. Keep an eye out for any signs of pest activity and take action promptly to prevent infestations.<br>4. **Mulch and retain moisture:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw, bark chips, or grass clippings) around your plants to retain soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.<br><br>By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in the beautiful city of Porvoo. Happy gardening!</p>
