            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">A lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:** With a temperature of 25.15°C (77.3°F) and humidity at 44%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as overwatering can be detrimental. Water your plants thoroughly, but avoid getting water on their leaves to prevent fungal diseases.

**Shades:** With few clouds in the sky, you might not need shades today. However, if you have plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight, consider providing a shade cloth or a physical shade structure to protect them from intense sun rays.

**What to plant today:** May is an excellent time to start planting in Porvoo! Consider sowing seeds for:

* Vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots
* Herbs like basil, mint, and chives
* Flowers like marigolds, zinnias, and sunflowers

Make sure to check the specific planting instructions for each type of plant you're interested in growing.

**Other useful hints:**

* Mulch your soil to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Organic mulches like straw or bark chips work well.
* Fertilize your plants with a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) to promote healthy growth.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Encourage beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings to visit your garden.

Enjoy your gardening experience in Porvoo today!</p>
