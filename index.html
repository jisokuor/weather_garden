<h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>With a temperature of 24.01°C (75.4°F) and humidity at 42%, it's an ideal day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as the overcast clouds might have reduced evaporation. Water in the morning or early afternoon to allow the plants to absorb the water throughout the day.<br><br>**Shades:**<br>The overcast sky will provide natural shade for your plants. If you have plants that require direct sunlight, consider providing temporary shading using shades or canopies to prevent scorching.<br><br>**What to Plant Today:**<br>May is an excellent month to plant a variety of crops in Porvoo's temperate climate. Consider planting:<br><br>1. Cool-season vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and lettuce, which thrive in the mild temperatures.<br>2. Herbaceous perennials like peonies, daylilies, or hostas, which can benefit from the moist soil.<br>3. Flower bulbs like tulips, daffodils, or hyacinths, which will bloom beautifully in the spring.<br><br>**Additional Tips:**<br><br>1. Take advantage of the gentle breeze (wind speed: 2.47 m/s) to reduce the risk of fungal diseases by providing good air circulation around your plants.<br>2. Mulch can help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Apply a thin layer of organic mulch around your plants.<br>3. Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which might be attracted to the moist conditions.<br><br>As the sun sets later than usual due to the time change (sunset: 1717097105), you can enjoy a peaceful evening in your garden, perhaps with some refreshments and good company. Happy gardening!</p>
