            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">Dear gardener!

As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

Given the weather data, here are some helpful hints:

**Watering:** With a relatively high humidity level (80%) and a comfortable temperature (15.7°C), your plants will appreciate a gentle watering. Make sure to check the soil moisture before giving them a drink, as you don't want to overwater.

**Shades:** Since it's May, the sun is still quite strong, especially during peak hours. Consider providing some shading for your plants, especially those that prefer partial shade or are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shades like trees or bushes or create artificial ones using gardening umbrellas or shade cloth.

**Planting Today:** With a mix of cloudy and sunny skies, today is an excellent day to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. Make sure the soil has warmed up enough (around 15°C) for these plants to thrive. You can also consider planting flowers that bloom in spring or early summer, such as roses, lilacs, or forget-me-nots.

**Other Hints:**

* As the wind speed is relatively low (1.48 m/s), you don't need to worry about securing your plants excessively.
* Keep an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases on your plants and take action if necessary.
* Take advantage of the mild weather to prune or train your plants, as needed.

Remember to always check the specific needs of each plant species before making any decisions. Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
