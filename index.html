<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>The lovely spring weather in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>Considering the temperature range (12-18°C) and humidity levels (23-35%), it's essential to water your plants adequately. Since we're experiencing a partly cloudy day with moderate temperatures, I recommend watering your plants in the morning or early afternoon when the sun is not too intense. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water, depending on the type of plants you have.<br><br>**Shades:**<br>With the sun shining brightly during the midday hours, it's a good idea to provide some shade for sensitive plants like ferns, impatiens, or begonias. You can use trellises, arbors, or even create DIY shades using cardboard or fabric sheets.<br><br>**Planting:**<br>May 21st is an excellent day to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and cucumbers. The soil should be moist but not waterlogged, and the air temperature should be around 15-20°C for optimal growth. Make sure to choose varieties suitable for your region and provide adequate support for climbing plants.<br><br>**Additional Tips:**<br><br>1. **Mulch:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (like straw or bark chips) around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.<br>2. **Pruning:** Prune any leggy stems or dead foliage from your perennials to promote healthy growth and encourage new blooms.<br>3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails, which might be attracted to the moisture and warmth. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.<br><br>**Looking ahead:**<br>As we move into the next three-hour intervals, the temperature will remain relatively stable, with a slight drop in the evening hours. The wind speed will increase slightly during the 15:00-18:00 interval, so be sure to secure any loose items or plants that might be affected by gusts.<br><br>**Final thoughts:**<br>May is an excellent time to get your garden started in Porvoo! With a little planning and attention to detail, you'll be enjoying a bountiful harvest in no time. Remember to check the weather forecast regularly for any updates and adjust your gardening routine accordingly.<br><br>Happy gardening, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns!</p>
