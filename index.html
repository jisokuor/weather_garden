<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share expert gardening tips and recommendations for today, May 17th, based on the provided weather data.<br><br>**Watering:** With temperatures ranging from 14.19°C (min) to 19.14°C (max), the soil may be quite dry due to the partly cloudy conditions. Make sure to water your plants thoroughly, especially those that require more moisture, such as ferns and hydrangeas. Water them in the morning or early evening when the sun isn't too intense.<br><br>**Shading:** Since it's still relatively sunny, consider setting up shades for sensitive plants like succulents, cacti, or those with delicate leaves. You can use old sheets, cloths, or even create a makeshift shade using sticks and branches. This will help protect them from direct sunlight.<br><br>**Planting Today:** May 17th is an excellent day to plant vegetables that prefer cooler temperatures, such as:<br><br>1. Leafy greens (lettuce, kale, spinach) - they'll thrive in the moderate temperatures.<br>2. Radishes - their fast growth rate means they can handle the slightly cool conditions.<br>3. Peas - sugar snap peas and snow peas love this time of year.<br><br>**Other Tips:**<br><br>1. Mulching: Add a layer of organic mulch (like straw, bark chips, or leaves) to your beds to retain moisture and suppress weeds.<br>2. Pruning: Take advantage of the mild weather to prune any overgrown branches on shrubs or perennials. This will encourage healthy growth and promote blooming.<br>3. Pest Control: Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, and snails, which tend to be more active in partly cloudy conditions. Use organic methods like neem oil, soap solutions, or hand-picking to control infestations.<br><br>**Additional Hints:**<br><br>1. Take note of the southeast wind direction (164 degrees) and consider planting wind-resistant species or using windbreaks for sensitive plants.<br>2. The relatively high humidity (59%) is beneficial for most plants, but keep an eye out for fungal diseases that might thrive in these conditions.<br><br>As you tend to your garden today, remember to enjoy the gentle breeze and the beauty of nature!</p>
