            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">Good morning from Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you based on today's weather forecast.

**Watering:** Given the relatively high humidity (87%) and gentle winds (3.02 m/s), it's essential to ensure your plants receive enough water. Check the soil moisture by inserting your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water! Water in the morning or evening when the sun isn't too intense.

**Shade:** With scattered clouds, you might not need additional shade for your plants. However, if you have sensitive plants that prefer shade, consider using a shade cloth or a physical barrier like a trellis or an umbrella to filter out direct sunlight.

**What to plant today:**
May is an excellent time to plant flowers and vegetables in Porvoo! Take advantage of the mild temperatures (18.94°C) and scattered clouds to sow:

1. **Vegetables:** Beans, peas, lettuce, spinach, and radishes are great choices for this time of year.
2. **Flowers:** Consider planting marigolds, zinnias, cosmos, or sunflowers that will thrive in the moderate weather.

**Additional tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the cloudy skies to prune any overgrown plants. This will help promote healthy growth and encourage blooming.
2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that might be attracted to the moisture. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap if necessary.
3. **Soil care:** As the soil temperature rises, consider adding a layer of compost or well-rotted manure to improve its structure and fertility.

Enjoy your gardening experience in Porvoo today!</p>
