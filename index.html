            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Given the pleasant weather conditions, here's what I suggest:

**Watering:** With temperatures reaching 25.14°C and humidity at 44%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture by inserting a finger into the soil up to the second knuckle. If the top inch of soil feels dry, it's time to water. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water per week, depending on the type of plants you have.

**Shades:** With few clouds in the sky, your plants will appreciate some shade protection during the hottest part of the day (usually between 11 am and 3 pm). You can use shading materials like burlap, cheesecloth, or even a makeshift trellis to provide filtered sunlight.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and okra. These plants thrive in temperatures above 20°C (68°F). You can also consider planting herbs like basil, mint, and lemongrass, which love the warmth and humidity.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw or wood chips) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. **Fertilizing:** Feed your plants with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth. For most vegetables and flowers, a 10-10-10 NPK ratio is suitable.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, whiteflies, and slugs. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible, such as neem oil or soap-based sprays.
4. **Companion Planting:** Consider planting complementary plants together to enhance growth, flavor, and pest resistance. For example, plant marigolds with tomatoes to repel nematodes.

**Additional Tips for the Month of May:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** As the soil warms up, it's an excellent time to till or aerate your garden beds to improve drainage and air circulation.
2. **Pruning:** Prune any deadheading flowers to encourage blooming and prevent seed production.

Enjoy your gardening experience in Porvoo, Finland!</p>
