            As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on the current weather forecast. Since we're in Finland, Porvoo, let's focus on adapting our gardening strategies to the local climate.

**Watering:**
Considering the relatively dry air (27% humidity) during most of the day, it's essential to water your plants thoroughly but not excessively. Aim for about 2-3 cups of water per plant, and make sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged. You can also use a drip irrigation system or soaker hose to conserve water.

**Shading:**
With mostly cloudy skies (19% cloud cover) and temperatures ranging from 14°C (24.9°F) to 21.7°C (71.1°F), providing shade for your plants is crucial, especially during the hottest part of the day. Use mulch, straw, or even a makeshift shade cloth to protect your plants.

**Planting:**
Considering the cool temperatures and humidity levels, it's an excellent time to plant species that thrive in temperate climates. Some recommendations include:

* Leafy greens like lettuce, spinach, and kale
* Root vegetables like carrots, beets, and potatoes
* Herbs like parsley, dill, and chives

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** Before planting, make sure the soil is well-draining and has a pH level suitable for your chosen plants.
2. **Fertilization:** Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) once or twice a month to promote healthy plant growth.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, slugs, and snails, and use organic methods to control them if necessary.
4. **Pruning:** Prune your plants regularly to maintain shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage fruiting or flowering.

**Weather Forecast:**
Based on the provided weather data, it appears that today will be mostly cloudy with temperatures ranging from 14°C (24.9°F) to 21.7°C (71.1°F). The humidity levels will be relatively low (27% in the morning and 36% in the afternoon), making it a good day for planting and maintenance.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in Porvoo, Finland. Happy gardening!
