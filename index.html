            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">Dear gardener, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland!

**Watering:** With the humidity at 94%, it's essential to ensure your plants are getting enough moisture. Water them thoroughly, but avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.

**Shades:** As the weather is mostly sunny with few clouds, you may want to provide some shade for your plants during the hottest part of the day (usually between 12 pm and 3 pm). This will help prevent scorching and promote healthy growth.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of vegetables, fruits, and flowers in Porvoo. Consider planting:

1. Radishes: They thrive in cool weather and can be harvested within 20-25 days.
2. Lettuce: A great choice for this time of year, with many varieties available.
3. Strawberries: May is a perfect month to plant strawberries in Finland. They'll start producing fruit in about 60 days.
4. Peas: Sugar snap peas or snow peas are excellent choices for this time of year.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Prune**: Use the sunny weather to prune your roses, shrubs, and trees. This will promote healthy growth and encourage blooming.
2. **Fertilize**: Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) to give your plants an extra boost of energy.
3. **Pest Control**: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which can thrive in warm weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
4. **Mulch**: Mulching your soil with a layer of organic material (e.g., straw, bark chips) will help retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

**Special Considerations:**

1. **Wind**: With wind speeds around 1.48 m/s, you may want to provide support for tall plants or use windbreaks to protect your garden from damage.
2. **Temperature**: As the temperature range is quite narrow (10.81°C - 15.52°C), ensure your plants are adapted to these conditions. Some plants might require protection from frost if temperatures drop.

By following these expert gardening tips and taking into account the weather forecast, you'll be well on your way to a thriving and beautiful garden in Porvoo, Finland!</p>
