<h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>What a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>Given the temperature is quite mild (12.57°C) and humidity is high (91%), I recommend watering your plants today, especially those that prefer a bit more moisture. However, avoid overwatering, as the soil may be prone to waterlogging. A gentle sprinkling or soaker hose should do the trick.<br><br>**Shades:**<br>With few clouds in the sky, you might not need any additional shades for most plants. However, if you have sensitive plants like ferns or impatiens, consider providing some shade using a shade cloth or a DIY solution like a cardboard box with holes cut out.<br><br>**What to plant today:**<br>May is an excellent time to start planting in Porvoo! With the soil warming up and the risk of frost decreasing, you can begin sowing seeds for:<br><br>1. Vegetables like lettuce, spinach, radishes, and peas.<br>2. Flowers like marigolds, zinnias, and sunflowers.<br><br>Make sure to choose varieties that are suitable for your region's climate and growing conditions.<br><br>**Other useful hints and tips:**<br><br>1. **Mulch:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (like straw or bark chips) around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.<br>2. **Pruning:** Prune any dead or damaged branches from your trees, shrubs, or perennials to promote healthy growth and encourage new blooms.<br>3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails, and take action if necessary. Organic pest control methods are always a good idea!<br>4. **Soil care:** Check the soil pH and adjust it if needed. May is a great time to add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and fertility.<br>5. **Gardening gloves:** Don't forget to wear comfortable gardening gloves to protect your hands from thorns, splinters, and other potential hazards!<br><br>Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
