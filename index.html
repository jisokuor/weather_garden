<h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the weather data provided, here are my suggestions:<br><br>**Watering:** With a relatively warm temperature of 25.32°C (77.6°F) and moderate humidity of 51%, it's essential to ensure your plants receive adequate moisture. Water them thoroughly this morning, but be cautious not to overwater, as the soil might still be drying out from yesterday.<br><br>**Shading:** The overcast clouds will provide some natural shade for your plants. However, if you have plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight or require specific light conditions, consider setting up temporary shades using umbrellas, canopies, or even cardboard boxes.<br><br>**Planting today:**<br><br>* May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants in Porvoo. The soil has warmed up sufficiently for these plants to thrive.<br>* Consider planting flowers that prefer partial shade, such as impatiens, begonias, or coleus, which will complement the natural shade provided by the overcast clouds.<br><br>**Additional tips:**<br><br>* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (1.98 m/s) to help pollinate your plants and distribute fragrances.<br>* With a moderate wind speed, ensure that any sensitive plants are securely staked or supported to prevent damage.<br>* Be mindful of potential frost pockets in shaded areas, especially as the temperature cools down at night. Protect vulnerable plants with blankets or covers if necessary.<br><br>**Tips for tomorrow:**<br><br>* As the temperature is expected to drop to 19.23°C (66.6°F) by evening, it's a good idea to prepare your plants for the change in weather.<br>* Bring potted plants indoors or provide additional shading for sensitive plants to ensure they remain comfortable.<br><br>Remember to check the weather forecast regularly and adjust your gardening plan accordingly. Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
