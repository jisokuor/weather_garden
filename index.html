<h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</3>
<p>A lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>With a relatively cool temperature of 13.06°C (54°F) and high humidity of 92%, it's essential to water your plants thoroughly but not excessively. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels dry, give your plants a good soaking. Avoid watering in direct sunlight to prevent fungal diseases.<br><br>**Shading:**<br>Since it's a clear sky day with no shade-providing clouds, make sure to provide some shading for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to full sun. You can use gardening stakes or trellises to create a natural canopy, or install a simple DIY shade cloth.<br><br>**Planting Today:**<br>May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo! With the soil still slightly cool, it's perfect for sowing seeds of cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas. You can also transplant young seedlings of tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers into larger containers or directly into the garden.<br><br>**Other Tips:**<br><br>1. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune your plants to maintain their shape and promote healthy growth.<br>2. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that thrive in warm weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.<br>3. **Soil Preparation:** If you're planning to start a new garden bed or container, prepare the soil by loosening it with a fork or trowel. Mix in some compost or well-rotted manure for added fertility.<br>4. **Support Structures:** Install support structures like stakes, trellises, or cages for plants that need them, such as peas, beans, and tomatoes.<br><br>**Weather Forecast:**<br>Looking ahead, the weather forecast shows scattered clouds moving in around 3:00 PM (UTC+2).
