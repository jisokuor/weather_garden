            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Considering the weather forecast, here are some advice on watering, setting shades, what to plant today, and other useful hints and tips:

**Watering:**
Given the high humidity (95%) and relatively cool temperature (11.16°C), it's essential to ensure your plants receive adequate moisture without overwatering. Check the soil moisture by inserting a finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels dry, it's time to water. Water your plants gently but thoroughly, making sure not to wash away any beneficial microbes or nutrients.

**Shading:**
As the sun can still be quite strong despite the few clouds, consider providing shade for your more sensitive plants, especially those with delicate foliage or blooms. You can use natural shades like trees, shrubs, or even a garden trellis with a sheer curtain. Alternatively, you can create a makeshift shade using a lightweight tarpaulin or a breathable shade cloth.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo, as the soil has warmed up, and the risk of frost has decreased. Today's temperature and humidity are suitable for planting a variety of plants, including:

1. Perennials like lavender, rosemary, or thyme that thrive in Mediterranean climates.
2. Cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, or radishes that do well in spring weather.
3. Flowering bulbs like tulips, daffodils, or hyacinths that can tolerate some shade and moist soil.

When planting, make sure to choose a spot with good drainage and adequate sunlight (if your plants require it). Prepare the soil by loosening it gently, adding any necessary organic matter, and mixing in a balanced fertilizer.

**Additional Tips:**

1. Mulch around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or slugs that might be attracted to the humidity and warm weather.
3. Consider installing a rain barrel or collecting water from a roof gutter to harvest rainwater for irrigation.
4. Deadhead spent flowers on perennials and annuals to encourage new blooms and promote healthy growth.

By following these tips and considering the current weather conditions, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving and resilient garden in Porvoo. Happy gardening!</p>
