            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">Dear gardener, based on the provided weather data and considering it's May in Porvoo, Finland, I'll offer some expert gardening tips for today.

**Watering:**
Given the temperature is around 10.81째C (50.6째F) with a humidity level of 94%, I recommend watering your plants moderately. The soil might be slightly cooler than usual due to the cloudy weather, so make sure not to overwater. A gentle soaking will suffice for most plants.

**Shading:**
As the sun is not intense today, you can consider removing any unnecessary shading structures like shade cloths or parasols. However, if your plants are particularly sensitive to direct sunlight, you may still want to provide some morning or afternoon shading.

**Planting:**
May is a great time to start planting in Porvoo! The weather is mild, and the soil has warmed up slightly. You can consider planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, or peas. These plants will thrive in the moderate temperatures and humidity. If you have warm-season crops like tomatoes or peppers, wait until the temperature reaches at least 15째C (59째F) for optimal growth.

**Other Tips:**

1. **Mulching:** With a relatively high humidity level, consider applying a thin layer of organic mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for potential pests like aphids or whiteflies, which might be attracted to the moisture. Use natural methods like introducing beneficial insects or spraying soapy water to control infestations.
3. **Pruning:** If you have deciduous trees or shrubs, now's a good time to prune them. The mild weather will allow for easy cutting and minimize stress on the plants.

By following these tips, your garden in Porvoo should thrive during this lovely May day!</p>
