Consider planting:<br>	* Vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and peas that thrive in cooler temperatures.<br>	* Herbs like mint, basil, and chives that prefer partial shade and moderate temperatures.<br>	* Flower bulbs like tulips, daffodils, or crocuses for a beautiful spring display.<br><br>**Additional Hints and Tips:**<br><br>1. **Soil preparation:** With the soil temperature around 19°C, it's an ideal time to prepare your garden beds for planting.
