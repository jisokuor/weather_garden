            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">Dear gardener, today is a perfect day to tend to your garden in Porvoo, Finland! With the temperature at 12.38Â°C and few clouds, you can expect a pleasant day with gentle sunshine. The humidity level of 89% will keep the soil moist, making it ideal for planting.

**Watering:** Since the weather is calm, you can water your plants as usual. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering to avoid overwatering. If the soil feels dry, give it a good soaking, but not so much that it becomes waterlogged.

**Shades:** With the sun shining brightly, consider setting up shades for your plants that need protection from direct sunlight. You can use gardening umbrellas or even create DIY shades using cardboard boxes and sticks.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables in Porvoo. Consider planting cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, which thrive in the slightly cooler temperatures. For warmer weather plants, like tomatoes and peppers, wait until the soil has warmed up a bit more.

**Other tips:**

* Take advantage of the calm wind to gently prune your plants or aerate the soil.
* Use this opportunity to inspect your garden for any signs of pests or diseases and take necessary action if needed.
* Don't forget to mulch your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

Remember to check the weather forecast regularly to plan ahead and make the most of the ideal gardening conditions. Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
