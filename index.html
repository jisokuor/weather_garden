**Watering:**
Since the humidity is relatively high at 89%, it's essential to avoid overwatering your plants. Stick to the usual watering schedule, but make sure the soil isn't waterlogged. You can always check the soil moisture by inserting a finger into the soil up to the knuckle. If it feels dry, it's time for a drink!

**Shading:**
As the temperature rises, consider providing some shade for your plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use shading materials like row covers or even create a DIY trellis with a lightweight material.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent month to plant a variety of vegetables and flowers in Porvoo! Consider sowing the following:

1. **Vegetables:** Radishes, spinach, lettuce, peas, carrots, beets, and herbs like parsley, dill, or chives.
2. **Flowers:** Marigolds, zinnias, sunflowers, cosmos, and sweet alyssum.

Remember to check the specific planting instructions for each variety of plant you're growing.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any overgrown plants or shrubs to promote healthy growth and encourage new blooms.
2. **Soil Preparation:** May is an excellent time to prepare your soil for the upcoming season. Add compost, well-rotted manure, or other organic matter to improve soil structure and fertility.
