            <h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</h3>
            <p id="dynamic-gardening-tips">As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:** With a temperature of 12.38°C and humidity of 89%, it's an excellent day to water your plants! Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot. If the soil feels dry to the touch, give it a good soaking. For most plants, this would be about 1-2 inches of water.

**Shades:** With few clouds in the sky and a gentle breeze, you might not need to set up shades just yet. However, if your plants are sensitive to direct sunlight or have a delicate foliage, consider providing some shade protection using umbrellas, canopies, or even old sheets.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo! The soil has started to warm up, and the risk of frost has decreased. Consider planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, peas, or potatoes. If you have a greenhouse or a sunroom, now's the perfect time to start seedlings for your summer garden.

**Other Hints and Tips:**

* Take advantage of the mild temperature to prune or divide perennials.
* Check your compost pile and turn it over if necessary. The humidity will help speed up decomposition.
* If you have a lawn, consider aerating it now. This will help improve drainage and reduce soil compaction.

Remember to always monitor the weather forecast and adjust your gardening plans accordingly. Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
