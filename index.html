<h3>Dynamic Gardening Tips</3>
<p>A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm happy to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>With a temperature of 13.06°C (May is still quite cool), it's essential to keep an eye on your plants' water needs. Since the humidity is relatively high at 92%, you might not need to water as much as you would during dryer periods. However, if you have plants that prefer moist soil, today would be a good day for a gentle watering.<br><br>**Shading:**<br>As the sun rises higher in the sky (around 6:00 AM), your plants might appreciate some shade, especially those with delicate leaves or sensitive to direct sunlight. Consider using shade cloths, umbrellas, or even cardboard boxes to filter the light.<br><br>**What to Plant Today:**<br>May is an excellent time to start planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas. These hardy veggies will thrive in the moderate temperatures and can be harvested in about 60-90 days. If you have a greenhouse or indoor space, now's the perfect time to start seedlings for later transplanting.<br><br>**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**<br><br>* Take advantage of the clear sky today and give your plants some extra TLC (tender loving care). Prune, fertilize, or repot as needed.<br>* As the wind speed is relatively low at 1.81 m/s, it's a good day for gentle plant training or pruning.<br>* Keep an eye on those pesky aphids and other pests that might be more active in this weather.<br><br>Remember to check the forecast regularly, as May can still bring some unpredictable weather patterns. Happy gardening in Porvoo!</p>
