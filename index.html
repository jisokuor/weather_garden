<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>A lovely spring evening in Porvoo! As your trusted Gardener of the Year, I'm excited to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations tailored to today's weather conditions.<br><br>**Watering:**<br>Considering the moderate humidity (47%) and gentle breeze from the northeastern direction, it's an excellent time to water your plants. The soil may still be slightly dry after a few days without significant rainfall. Water your plants thoroughly, taking care not to overwater, especially those that prefer well-drained conditions.<br><br>**Shades:**<br>With broken clouds and scattered cloud cover, there will be moments of direct sunlight. To protect sensitive plants from scorching, consider setting up temporary shades or using shade cloth to filter the sun's rays. This is particularly important for young seedlings, succulents, or plants that are still getting established.<br><br>**What to plant today:**<br>May 17th in Porvoo is an ideal time to start planting warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. The soil has warmed up, and the risk of frost has decreased. You can also sow seeds for zucchini, eggplant, and okra. If you have a greenhouse or a sunroom, now's the perfect opportunity to start seedlings for these plants.<br><br>**Other useful hints:**<br>1. **Soil preparation:** As the soil temperature rises, it's an excellent time to till the soil and incorporate organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure. This will help improve soil structure, increase its water-holding capacity, and provide nutrients for your plants.<br>2. **Pest control:** With the gentle breeze, consider using floating row covers or fine-mesh screens to prevent pests like whiteflies, aphids, or thrips from reaching your plants.<br>3. **Pruning:** Take advantage of this partly cloudy evening to prune shrubs and trees that require it. Prune judiciously, as some plants may still be sensitive to frost.<br>4. **Supports:** As plants grow taller or produce fruit, provide support using stakes, trellises, or cages to keep them upright and promote healthy growth.<br><br>**Additional tips:**<br>- Keep an eye out for any signs of spring pests like slugs or snails, which can become active in warmer weather.<br>- Consider installing a rain gauge to monitor rainfall and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.<br>- Mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.<br><br>By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to enjoying a bountiful harvest in Porvoo this spring!</p>
