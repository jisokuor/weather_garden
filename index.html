<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>Dear fellow gardener! On this lovely spring morning in Porvoo, Finland, I'm delighted to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.<br><br>**Watering:** Given the moderate temperature and low humidity, it's an excellent idea to water your plants today. However, due to the cloudy weather, I recommend watering them early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun isn't too intense. This will help prevent moisture loss through evapotranspiration.<br><br>**Shading:** As the sun might be hidden behind clouds, it's not essential to provide additional shading for your plants today. However, if you have sensitive species that still require protection from direct sunlight, consider using a lightweight shade cloth or a sheer curtain to filter the sun's rays.<br><br>**Planting:** May 21st is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants in Porvoo! The soil has warmed up sufficiently, and the risk of frost has diminished. Make sure to choose varieties that are resistant to late frosts and cold snaps.<br><br>**Additional Tips:**<br><br>1. **Soil preparation:** With the soil temperature rising, it's an ideal time to prepare your beds for planting. Mix in some organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and fertility.<br>2. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any overgrown shrubs or perennials. This will help promote healthy growth, encourage new blooms, and maintain a tidy appearance.<br>3. **Companion planting:** Consider planting companion species that complement the warm-season crops you're planning to plant. For example, basil and tomatoes are a classic combination that can enhance flavor and reduce pests.<br>4. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for early signs of pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites on your plants. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible to maintain a balanced ecosystem.<br><br>**Weather Forecast:** As the weather data indicates, the next 3-hour interval will see continued cloudy conditions with a gentle breeze. This is perfect for seedlings and young plants that benefit from the reduced direct sunlight.<br><br>I hope these expert gardening tips and recommendations help you make the most of this lovely spring day in Porvoo!</p>
