<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share expert gardening tips and recommendations based on the current weather forecast. Let's dive in!<br><br>**Watering:** With a comfortable temperature of 18.67°C (65.61°F), it's an ideal time to water your plants. Since the humidity is relatively low at 22%, your plants will appreciate a good soaking. Water thoroughly, but make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot.<br><br>**Setting Shades:** The sun is shining, and with broken clouds, it's a perfect day to set up shades for your plants that require partial shade or protection from the intense sunlight. You can use physical shades, such as umbrellas or fabric canopies, or even create a DIY shade using cardboard boxes and some twine.<br><br>**What to Plant Today:** For today, I recommend planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, radishes, or peas. These plants thrive in the moderate temperatures (around 18°C/64°F) and will love the gentle breeze. If you have tomatoes or peppers already started indoors, it's a great day to transplant them into larger pots or directly into the garden.<br><br>**Other Useful Hints:**<br><br>1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the pleasant weather to prune your plants that require regular pruning, such as roses, lavender, or herbs like mint and lemongrass.<br>2. **Weeding:** As the soil is still slightly moist from last night's dew, today's a great day to tackle weeding in your garden beds. Be gentle not to disturb the roots of nearby plants.<br>3. **Companion Planting:** Consider planting companion plants like marigolds or nasturtiums near your vegetables. These flowers repel pests and attract beneficial insects, promoting a healthy and balanced ecosystem.<br>4. **Soil Care:** With the wind speed relatively low, today's an excellent day to add organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to your soil. This will help improve its structure and fertility.<br><br>**Additional Tips for Finns:**<br><br>1. **Take advantage of the sunny spell:** Use this lovely weather to get a head start on your gardening tasks. The more you do now, the less you'll have to worry about later.<br>2. **Don't forget about pest control:** With the warm temperatures and gentle breeze, some pests might become active. Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, or snails, and take action if necessary.<br><br>There you have it! A comprehensive guide for today's gardening in Porvoo, Finland. Make the most of this lovely spring day, and happy gardening!</p>
