<h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>The lovely spring weather in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert tips and recommendations with you. Given the current weather data, here's what I suggest:<br><br>**Watering:**<br>As the temperature is a comfortable 19.41°C (67°F), it's an ideal time to water your plants. However, considering the relatively low humidity of 25%, it might be wise to avoid overwatering. Instead, focus on providing gentle and consistent moisture to your plants. You can do this by using soaker hoses or drip irrigation systems.<br><br>**Shades:**<br>With a cloud cover of only 19%, you won't need to worry about excessive sunlight today. However, if you have plants that prefer partial shade, now's a great time to provide some shading to protect them from the gentle morning sun.<br><br>**Planting Today:**<br>May is an excellent month to plant many vegetables and flowers in Porvoo. With the soil warming up, it's perfect for planting:<br><br>1. Cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale.<br>2. Root vegetables like carrots, beets, and potatoes.<br>3. Perennials like strawberry plants, which thrive in our region's climate.<br><br>**Additional Hints:**<br><br>1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the pleasant weather to prune your plants. Remove any dead or damaged foliage to promote healthy growth and encourage blooming.<br>2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which are common in this time of year. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.<br>3. **Companion planting:** When planting new vegetables or flowers, consider their companion plant benefits. For example, basil repels pests that target tomatoes, while marigolds attract beneficial insects.<br><br>**General Tips:**<br><br>1. Keep an eye on the weather forecast for any potential rain showers, and be prepared to adjust your watering schedule accordingly.<br>2. Take advantage of the gentle breeze by using wind chimes or other auditory deterrents to keep birds away from your plants.<br>3. Mulch your soil to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.<br><br>Enjoy the beautiful spring weather in Porvoo, and happy gardening!</p>
