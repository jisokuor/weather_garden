## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the provided weather data, here are some advice and hints:

**Watering:**
Considering the humidity is high (88%), it's essential to avoid overwatering your plants. Instead, focus on providing them with consistent moisture levels. Water your plants deeply once or twice a day, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings.

**Shades:**
With only few clouds in the sky and no direct sun, you can minimize the use of shades for most plants. However, if you have sensitive plants like ferns or impatiens, consider providing them with some gentle shading during the peak sun hours (around 9:00 AM).

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo's climate. Today, I recommend planting:

1. Cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, or kale, which thrive in temperatures between 12째C to 15째C (54째F - 59째F).
2. Herbs like mint, basil, or thyme, which prefer well-drained soil and partial shade.
3. Flowers like pansies, violas, or sweet alyssum, which enjoy the mild weather and can tolerate some morning dew.

**Other Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** Before planting, make sure your soil is loose and has good drainage. You can mix in some organic matter like compost to improve its structure.
2. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any overgrown plants or shrubs to maintain their shape and promote healthy growth.
3. **Mulching:** Apply a thin layer of mulch (about 1-2 inches) around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a lush and thriving garden in Porvoo. Happy gardening!
