## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm excited to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:** With a pleasant temperature of 25.14Â°C and humidity levels at 44%, it's an ideal day to water your plants. Make sure to give them a good soaking, but avoid overwatering as the soil may not dry out quickly due to the cloudy skies.

**Shades:** As there are only few clouds in the sky, you can consider removing any shades or covers on your plants. This will allow them to receive sufficient sunlight and warmth.

**Planting:** May is a great time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. The soil temperature has warmed up nicely, making it suitable for direct sowing. You can also start seedlings indoors and transplant them once the weather stabilizes.

**Tips:**

* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (3.41 m/s) by pruning or training your plants to grow upwards.
* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which may be attracted to the warm weather.

**Additional Hints:**

* Check the soil moisture before watering to avoid overwatering. Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle; if it feels dry, it's time to water.
* Consider using drip irrigation or soaker hoses to deliver water directly to the roots of your plants, reducing evaporation and runoff.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in Porvoo. Happy gardening!
