## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Dear gardener, I'm delighted to share my expert advice and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:**
Considering the warm temperature (25.1Â°C) and moderate humidity (50%), it's an excellent day to water your plants. Aim for about 2-3 times their usual watering amount to help them thrive in this pleasant weather.

**Shading:**
As the sun is shining brightly, providing shade for sensitive plants or those that require protection from intense sunlight will be beneficial. Consider using a shade cloth or placing plants near a natural shaded area.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers in Porvoo. The weather conditions are suitable for their growth, and the soil should still be workable. Make sure to choose varieties that mature quickly (around 60-70 days) to enjoy your harvest before the summer heat sets in.

**Additional Tips:**

* Take advantage of the mild temperatures to prune or train plants, as needed.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids and whiteflies, which can thrive in warm weather. Use organic control methods whenever possible.
* Mulch around plants to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.
* Deadhead flowers to encourage more blooms and prevent seed production.

As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I hope these tips help you tend to your garden with confidence and joy!
