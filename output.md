## Dynamic Gardening Tips
The lovely city of Porvoo in Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today's weather conditions.

**Watering:**
With a humidity level of 93% and a clear sky, it's essential to ensure your plants are not too thirsty. Water them gently but thoroughly, especially those that prefer moist soil like ferns or hostas. However, avoid overwatering, as the soil might become waterlogged. Instead, focus on providing consistent moisture throughout the day.

**Shading:**
As the sun will be shining brightly today, consider providing some shading for your plants to prevent scorching. You can use natural shade sources like trees or buildings or create artificial shades using umbrellas, canopies, or even DIY trellises.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo's mild climate. Today's weather conditions are perfect for planting cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale. You can also sow seeds for marigolds, zinnias, or sunflowers that will bloom later in the season.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** With a gentle breeze of 1.81 m/s, it's an ideal day to till your soil and prepare it for planting.
2. **Mulch:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, or snails that might be active in the moist conditions. Use natural pest control methods like neem oil, soap solutions, or hand-picking to minimize harm.
