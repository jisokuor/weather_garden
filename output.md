## Gardening Tips
The lovely spring weather in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.

**Watering:**
Considering the temperature range (12-18°C) and humidity levels (23-35%), it's essential to water your plants adequately. Since we're experiencing a partly cloudy day with moderate temperatures, I recommend watering your plants in the morning or early afternoon when the sun is not too intense. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water, depending on the type of plants you have.

**Shades:**
With the sun shining brightly during the midday hours, it's a good idea to provide some shade for sensitive plants like ferns, impatiens, or begonias. You can use trellises, arbors, or even create DIY shades using cardboard or fabric sheets.

**Planting:**
May 21st is an excellent day to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and cucumbers. The soil should be moist but not waterlogged, and the air temperature should be around 15-20°C for optimal growth. Make sure to choose varieties suitable for your region and provide adequate support for climbing plants.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Mulch:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (like straw or bark chips) around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. **Pruning:** Prune any leggy stems or dead foliage from your perennials to promote healthy growth and encourage new blooms.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails, which might be attracted to the moisture and warmth. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.

**Looking ahead:**
As we move into the next three-hour intervals, the temperature will remain relatively stable, with a slight drop in the evening hours. The wind speed will increase slightly during the 15:00-18:00 interval, so be sure to secure any loose items or plants that might be affected by gusts.

**Final thoughts:**
May is an excellent time to get your garden started in Porvoo! With a little planning and attention to detail, you'll be enjoying a bountiful harvest in no time. Remember to check the weather forecast regularly for any updates and adjust your gardening routine accordingly.

Happy gardening, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns!
