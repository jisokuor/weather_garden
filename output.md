## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:**
Given the warm temperature (24.28°C) and moderate humidity (42%), it's a perfect day to water your plants! Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as the clouds might provide some shade. Aim to give your plants about 1-2 inches of water, depending on their needs.

**Shade:**
With broken clouds in the sky, you can still get some direct sunlight, but it's also a good idea to provide shade for your more sensitive plants. Consider using shade cloth or placing plants under trees or awnings to protect them from intense sunbeams.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants in Porvoo. The soil has warmed up enough to support their growth, and the mild temperatures will help them establish a strong root system. Don't forget to choose varieties that are resistant to fungal diseases, as the humidity might encourage their growth.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.
* Keep an eye out for slugs and snails, as they might become more active in this humid weather. Use copper tape or crushed eggshells to deter them.
* If you have plants that require full sun, consider moving them to a spot with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to growing a thriving and healthy garden in Porvoo!
