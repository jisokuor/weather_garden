## Dynamic Gardening Tips
What a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.

**Watering:**
Given the overcast weather conditions and relatively low humidity (41%), your plants will likely appreciate a moderate watering today. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water per square foot, depending on the soil type and plant needs. This should help keep them hydrated without causing waterlogging.

**Shades:**
The overcast clouds will provide natural shading for your plants, reducing the need for additional shade structures. However, if you have sensitive or sun-loving plants, consider providing some supplementary shading using sheer curtains, shade cloth, or even a small umbrella to filter the sunlight.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of vegetables and flowers in Porvoo. Consider sowing seeds for:

1. Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale) that prefer cooler temperatures.
2. Radishes, which thrive in the moderate temperature and humidity.
3. Tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers that can be planted after the last frost date.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Mulching:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (about 1-2 inches) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the overcast weather to prune your plants, removing any dead or damaged leaves to promote healthy growth.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails that might be attracted to the moisture and humidity. Use natural methods to control their populations, such as introducing beneficial insects or spraying with water.
4. **Soil Preparation:** As the soil temperature cools down, consider adding a layer of compost or well-rotted manure to improve its structure and fertility.

**Additional Tips for May Gardening in Porvoo:**

1. Watch out for late frosts! Temperatures can still drop significantly at night, so be prepared to protect sensitive plants.
2. Take advantage of the long days (up to 18 hours of daylight) to get a head start on your gardening tasks.
3. Keep an eye on weather forecasts and be prepared to adjust your watering schedule accordingly.

Enjoy your gardening adventure in Porvoo!
