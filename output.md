## Dynamic Gardening Tips
The lovely month of May in Porvoo, Finland! Based on the weather data provided, I'm happy to offer the following expert gardening tips and recommendations for today:

**Watering:** With a relatively cool temperature (13.06°C) and high humidity (93%), it's essential to ensure your plants receive adequate moisture. Water them thoroughly, but make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot and other issues.

**Shades:** The clear sky during the morning hours will provide ample sunlight for most plants. However, consider setting up shades or providing some afternoon shade for sensitive plants that may be prone to scorching in direct sunlight.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of vegetables, herbs, and flowers in Porvoo's temperate climate. Consider planting cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, or carrots today. For warm-season crops, wait until the temperature rises above 15°C (59°F).

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** With the soil still relatively cold, focus on preparing it for future plantings by adding organic matter and perlite to improve drainage.
2. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any deciduous trees or shrubs that have finished blooming. This will help maintain shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage new blooms.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like slugs, snails, and aphids, which may be more active during the cooler morning hours. Use organic methods to control infestations.
4. **Composting:** Continue adding kitchen scraps and yard waste to your compost pile. The cool temperatures will help break down materials faster.

**Upcoming weather forecast:** By 3:00 PM (1717124400), scattered clouds are expected, which may bring some relief from the direct sunlight. Later in the day, broken clouds are predicted, with a gentle breeze.

Remember to dress warmly and stay hydrated while working outdoors today!
