## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:** Given the overcast weather and moderate humidity (84%), it's essential to water your plants accordingly. Check the soil moisture before watering, but if it feels dry, give them a good soaking. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water per week, depending on the plant species and growth stage.

**Shades:** With an overcast sky, you can provide some shade for sensitive plants or those that prefer partial sunlight. You may not need to worry about additional shading today, but it's always a good idea to have some on hand for when the sun breaks through the clouds.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo! Take advantage of the mild temperatures (around 15°C) and moderate humidity to get your flowers, herbs, or vegetables started. Today's weather conditions are suitable for planting a variety of species, including:

* Cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, or kale
* Herbs like mint, basil, or thyme
* Perennials like daffodils, tulips, or hyacinths

Remember to choose plants that thrive in partial shade and cooler temperatures.

**Additional Tips:**

* Keep an eye on wind speeds; while today's winds are moderate (0.52 m/s), strong gusts can still damage delicate stems or disrupt plant growth.
* Monitor temperature fluctuations; if the sun breaks through, it might cause a slight temperature spike.
* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
* Deadhead flowers regularly to encourage more blooms and maintain plant appearance.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in Porvoo!
