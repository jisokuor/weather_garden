## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. With clear skies, mild temperatures, and moderate humidity, it's an excellent day for gardening.

**Watering:**
Since the temperature is quite pleasant, you can water your plants thoroughly. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Water your plants in the morning or early afternoon to allow them to absorb the water throughout the day.

**Shades:**
With clear skies, direct sunlight won't be a concern today. However, if you have plants that require shade, consider setting up temporary shades using umbrellas, canopies, or even sheets to protect them from potential heatwaves later in the month.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and peas. These cool-season crops thrive in the mild temperatures and can be harvested within a few weeks. You can also start sowing flowers like marigolds, nasturtiums, and violas for added color and fragrance.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** As the soil starts to warm up, it's essential to prepare your garden beds by loosening the top 8-10 inches of soil. This will help improve drainage, aeration, and root growth.
2. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the mild weather to prune your plants, especially shrubs and trees. Remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth and prevent disease.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and slugs, which can thrive in warm and humid conditions. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible to minimize harm to your plants and the environment.
4. **Compost:** Continue adding compost or well-rotted manure to your garden beds to improve soil fertility and structure.

**Conclusion:**
Today is an excellent day for gardening in Porvoo, Finland! Take advantage of the pleasant weather to tend to your plants, prepare your soil, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Happy gardening!
