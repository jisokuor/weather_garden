## Gardening Tips
The beautiful city of Porvoo in Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.

**Watering:**
Since it's going to be a relatively cool and overcast day, you don't need to water your plants excessively. However, if the soil feels dry to the touch or your plants are showing signs of stress, go ahead and give them a gentle soaking. Make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot and other issues.

**Shades:**
With the cloud cover expected throughout the day, you might want to provide some shade for your plants that prefer partial shade or full sun. You can use shade cloth, row covers, or even create a DIY shade structure using sticks and fabric. This will help protect your plants from direct sunlight and promote healthy growth.

**What to Plant:**
Given the mild temperatures (around 16°C/61°F) and gentle winds, today is an excellent day to plant cool-season crops like:

* Lettuce
* Spinach
* Radishes
* Peas
* Carrots

These plants will thrive in the current weather conditions. Make sure to choose varieties that are suitable for your region's growing season.

**Other Hints and Tips:**

* Fertilize your plants according to their specific needs. A balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 NPK) would be a good starting point.
* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or slugs, which might take advantage of the cloudy weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
* Prune or train your plants as needed to promote healthy growth and encourage fruiting.

**Weather Insights:**
As you can see from the weather data, the temperature will remain relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight drop in the morning hours (16.72°C/61.2°F). The humidity is expected to be around 80-83%, which should keep your plants happy and hydrated. The wind speed is moderate, ranging from 1.91 km/h to 0.5 km/h (1.2 mph to 0.3 mph), but the direction remains relatively consistent.
