## Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations based on the weather data for today, May 18th, 2024.

**Watering:**
Considering the temperature range (19.54°C - 19.6°C) and humidity level (40%), it's essential to maintain a moderate watering schedule. Water your plants thoroughly in the morning or early afternoon when the sun is not too intense. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot and other issues.

**Shades:**
With broken clouds and a moderate wind direction (146 degrees), create some shade for your plants by using natural or artificial shading materials. This will help regulate the temperature and reduce stress caused by direct sunlight. You can use umbrellas, awnings, or even install trellises with vines to provide shade.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of crops in Porvoo's climate. Consider planting:
	* Vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and peas that thrive in cooler temperatures.
	* Herbs like mint, basil, and chives that prefer partial shade and moderate temperatures.
	* Flower bulbs like tulips, daffodils, or crocuses for a beautiful spring display.

**Additional Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** With the soil temperature around 19°C, it's an ideal time to prepare your garden beds for planting. Loosen the soil, add organic matter, and mix well.
2. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the moderate weather to prune or trim plants that need attention. This will help promote healthy growth and encourage blooming.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails, which might be more active in this temperature range. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
4. **Companion planting:** Consider companion planting to create a balanced ecosystem. For example, plant marigolds with tomatoes to deter nematodes and attract beneficial insects.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving and beautiful garden in Porvoo!
