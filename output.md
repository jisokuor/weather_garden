## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Hello there! As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:** With a temperature of 18.94Â°C (May is an excellent month for planting), I recommend watering your plants thoroughly but not excessively. The humidity level is quite high at 87%, so you might want to reduce the frequency or amount of water slightly to avoid overwatering.

**Shades:** As it's a sunny day with scattered clouds, providing some shade for your plants will be beneficial, especially if they're sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial ones to protect them from the harsh sun.

**What to plant today:** May is an excellent month for planting in Porvoo! The soil temperature has warmed up, and the risk of frost has decreased significantly. I recommend planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, peas, carrots, and radishes. You can also start sowing seeds for summer crops like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers.

**Other useful hints:**

* As the wind speed is relatively low at 3.02 m/s (around 6 mph), you don't need to worry about securing your plants excessively.
* Keep an eye out for aphids or other pests that might be attracted to the warmth and humidity.
* Mulch your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in Porvoo. Happy gardening!
