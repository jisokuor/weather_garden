## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Considering the weather data and the month of May, here are some advice on watering, setting shades, what to plant today, and other useful hints and tips:

**Watering:** With a temperature of 18.94°C (64°F) and humidity at 87%, it's essential to water your plants thoroughly but not excessively. Check the soil moisture before watering, and consider using drip irrigation or soaker hoses to conserve water.

**Shades:** The scattered clouds will provide some natural shade, which is perfect for plants that prefer partial sunlight. If you have plants that require full sun, consider setting up a temporary shade cloth or trellis to filter the intense morning sun.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants in Porvoo. The soil has warmed up, and the air temperature is suitable for these plants to thrive. Make sure to harden off your seedlings before transplanting them into the garden.

**Other Tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the mild weather to prune your shrubs and perennials. Remove any dead or damaged branches to promote healthy growth.
2. **Weeding:** Keep an eye out for weeds that may have emerged with the recent rain. Regular weeding will prevent competition for water and nutrients.
3. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw, bark chips, or compost) around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
4. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that thrive in warm weather. Use neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introduce beneficial insects to maintain a balanced ecosystem.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. Plant flowers like marigolds, zinnias, and cosmos to attract pollinators and add color to your garden.
2. Consider planting potatoes, carrots, and other root vegetables, which do well in the cooler temperatures of early May.
3. Take advantage of the gentle breeze (wind speed 3.02 m/s) to create a natural air circulation in your garden, reducing the risk of fungal diseases.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving and resilient garden in Porvoo, Finland. Happy gardening!
