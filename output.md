## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A beautiful day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.

**Watering:** Given the moderate temperature (11.36°C) and high humidity (93%), it's an excellent idea to water your plants today. However, since the sun is shining brightly under a clear sky, be cautious not to overwater. Check the soil moisture by inserting your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water per plant.

**Shade:** With the sun being so strong, consider providing some shade for your plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use umbrellas, shade cloths, or even a trellis with a climbing vine to create a natural canopy.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant flowers and vegetables in Porvoo. Consider planting cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, or spinach. For flowers, you can't go wrong with colorful annuals like marigolds, petunias, or zinnias.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** Before planting, make sure the soil is well-draining and has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. You can add organic matter like compost or manure to improve the soil's structure.
2. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails, which might be more active in the warm weather. Use natural methods like neem oil or hand-picking to control infestations.
3. **Fertilization:** Feed your plants with a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 NPK) to promote healthy growth and development.
4. **Pruning:** Prune any dead or damaged plant material to prevent the spread of disease and encourage new growth.

**Additional Tips for May in Porvoo:**

1. **Weather Forecast:** Keep an eye on the weather forecast, as May can be quite unpredictable in terms of temperature and precipitation.
2. **Soil Temperature:** Wait until the soil has warmed up to at least 10°C (50°F) before planting warm-season crops like tomatoes or peppers.
3. **Pollination:** Many plants are now in bloom, so consider attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies by adding a few flowers with nectar-rich blooms.

Enjoy your gardening journey in Porvoo!
