## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.

**Watering:**
Given the high humidity (94%) and moderate temperature (10.81°C), it's essential to provide your plants with adequate water supply. Water them thoroughly this morning, making sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged. As the day warms up, check the soil regularly to ensure it doesn't dry out too quickly.

**Shading:**
With only a few clouds (20%) expected today, you can leave your shade structures in place for now. However, keep an eye on the weather forecast and adjust your shading accordingly if the cloud cover increases or the sun becomes stronger.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of crops in Porvoo. Today, consider sowing seeds for early summer vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. Make sure the soil is well-draining and has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the calm weather to prune any overgrown branches or stems on your plants. This will promote healthy growth and encourage fruiting.
2. **Soil preparation:** With the soil temperatures rising, it's an excellent time to prepare your garden beds for planting. Loosen the soil gently with a fork to aerate it and improve drainage.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for any signs of pests like aphids or slugs, which can thrive in humid conditions. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.

**Weather Forecast:**
The weather is expected to remain mostly sunny with scattered clouds (27%) later this morning and into the afternoon. The temperature will gradually rise to around 15.5°C (60°F) by midday, with a gentle breeze of approximately 3.02 m/s (6.7 mph). Tonight, expect clear skies with a low of around 10.8°C (51.4°F).
