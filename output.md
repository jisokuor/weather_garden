**Watering:**
Given the comfortable temperature and moderate wind speed, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to provide adequate moisture to your soil, especially for young seedlings or newly planted areas. Aim to provide about 2-3 cm (0.8-1.2 inches) of water per week, depending on the type of plants you have.

**Shading:**
With mostly cloudy skies and a moderate wind speed, your plants won't need additional shading today. However, if you have plants that require protection from intense sunlight or strong winds, consider using shade cloths or trellises to provide them with some relief.

**What to Plant Today:**
May 19th is an excellent time to plant flowers and vegetables in Porvoo! The soil has warmed up nicely, and the risk of frost has decreased. You can plant:

1. Vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and carrots.
2. Flowers such as marigolds, zinnias, cosmos, and sunflowers.

Remember to check the specific planting instructions for each variety you're planting.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** Before planting, make sure your soil is well-prepared by loosening it up to a depth of about 30 cm (12 inches). This will help roots grow freely and prevent waterlogging.
2. **Mulching:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch like straw or compost around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
3. **Pest Management:** Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, slugs, and snails. Consider using natural pest control methods like introducing beneficial insects or spraying with soapy water.
