**Watering:** With a relatively high humidity of 94%, it's essential to water your plants carefully. Since the temperature is around 11°C (51°F), you can water them as usual, but make sure not to overwater. The gentle wind speed of 1.48 m/s might also help in preventing water loss through evaporation.

**Shades:** With few clouds forecasted for today, it's a good idea to provide some shade for your plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use garden shades or simply prune any trees or shrubs that block the sun's rays.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of vegetables and flowers in Porvoo. Consider planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, carrots, or peas. For flowers, you might enjoy planting lavender, marigolds, or petunias, which thrive in the cooler temperatures and moderate sunlight.

**Additional Hints:**

* Take advantage of the mild weather to prune any overgrown branches or stems on your plants.
* Check the soil moisture regularly, as it might be slightly higher due to the humidity. Avoid walking on wet soil to prevent compacting it.
* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and regulate the soil temperature.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, which can thrive in these conditions.
