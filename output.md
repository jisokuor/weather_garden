## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:**
Given the warm temperature (23.18°C) and moderate humidity (62%), your plants might appreciate a gentle watering session this morning. Make sure to water them thoroughly, but avoid overwatering, as it may lead to root rot and other issues.

**Shading:**
With few clouds in the sky, I recommend providing some shade for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use umbrellas or create a makeshift canopy using sticks and leaves.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. The mild temperatures and adequate moisture will help them get established quickly. If you're planning to start seedlings indoors, today's a great day to do so!

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

* Take advantage of the pleasant weather and spend some time pruning your plants or tidying up the garden beds.
* Keep an eye on those pesky aphids and whiteflies; with the warm temperatures, they might be more active than usual. Use neem oil or insecticidal soap to control infestations.
* Consider mulching around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Organic mulch like straw or bark chips works wonders!
* Don't forget to fertilize your plants! May is an excellent time to apply a balanced fertilizer, as the soil is still relatively cool, allowing the nutrients to be absorbed efficiently.

**Additional Tips:**
Given the wind speed (3.41 m/s), you might want to secure any loose plants or containers to prevent them from getting blown away. Also, keep an eye on your garden's overall moisture levels; the warm temperatures can cause soil drying out quickly.
