## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Given the weather data provided, here's what I have to say:

**Watering:** Since the temperature is around 15Â°C with 80% humidity, it's a good idea to water your plants moderately. You don't want to overwater them, as this could lead to root rot or other problems. A gentle soaking should be sufficient for most plants.

**Setting Shades:** With only few clouds in the sky, you might not need to worry about setting shades just yet. However, if you have plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight, consider providing some shade using umbrellas, canopies, or even cardboard boxes with holes cut out (just like the Finns do!).

**What to Plant Today:** May is a great time to start planting in Porvoo! With the mild temperature and decent humidity, it's an ideal season for sowing seeds of flowers, vegetables, and herbs. You could try planting some early crops like radishes, lettuce, or spinach, or get started with your summer flower garden by planting marigolds, zinnias, or sunflowers.

**Additional Tips:**

* Since the wind speed is relatively low (1.48 m/s), you can leave your plants exposed to the gentle breeze.
* Keep an eye on those pesky aphids and other pests that might be attracted to the sweet nectar of blooming flowers.
* Take advantage of the pleasant weather to get some pruning done, especially for plants like roses, which benefit from a bit of deadheading (removing spent blooms).
* Consider composting any organic waste you have lying around. With the right balance of "green" and "brown" materials, your soil will thank you when the time comes to plant new seeds.

Overall, it seems like today is a perfect day for some light gardening tasks or even just enjoying the fresh air and sunshine!
