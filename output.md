## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Dear gardener!

As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you, based on today's weather forecast.

**Watering:** Given the humidity level is at 94%, it's essential to avoid overwatering your plants. Instead, focus on providing them with gentle, consistent moisture levels. Watering in the morning will help prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth throughout the day.

**Shades:** With the temperature expected to rise slightly as the day progresses (10.81°C to 19.9°C), it's crucial to provide your plants with some shade protection. Consider using a lightweight, breathable canopy or even just placing mulch around your plants to help regulate soil temperatures and prevent scorching.

**What to Plant:** May is an excellent time for planting in Porvoo! The moderate temperatures (around 15°C) and humidity create perfect conditions for a wide range of crops. Consider sowing seeds for lettuce, spinach, peas, beans, or herbs like mint, basil, or parsley. These plants will thrive in the mild climate and can be harvested within a few weeks.

**Additional Tips:**

* Mulch your beds to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperatures.
* Prune any dead or diseased plant material to prevent the spread of diseases and encourage healthy growth.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which may become active in these warmer temperatures.
