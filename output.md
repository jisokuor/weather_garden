## Gardening Tips
A lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm excited to share my expert tips and recommendations with you. Given the weather conditions, here's what I suggest:

**Watering:** Today is a great day to water your plants, as the temperature is relatively mild (24°C) and there's no strong wind to wash away the moisture. Water your plants deeply, but make sure not to overwater, especially for those with shallow root systems.

**Shades:** With mostly cloudy skies and scattered clouds, it's a good idea to provide some shade for your plants that prefer partial or full sun. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial shades made of canvas or mesh. This will help prevent scorching and ensure your plants receive the right amount of sunlight.

**Planting:** May 27th is an excellent day to plant flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo! The soil should be warm enough for most seeds to germinate. Consider planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, or peas, which thrive in this temperature range. For flowering plants, you can't go wrong with petunias, pansies, or snapdragons.

**Other tips:**

* Take advantage of the excellent visibility and enjoy your garden's beauty while doing some pruning or weeding.
* As the relative humidity is around 53%, it's an ideal day for propagating cuttings or taking semi-ripe hardwood cuttings. This will help reduce transpiration and minimize water loss during the rooting process.
* Keep an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases, especially with the changing weather patterns.

**Additional advice:**

* For plants that prefer warmer temperatures, consider using row covers or cloches to retain heat and protect them from cooler temperatures at night.
* If you have plants that are prone to wind damage, consider providing additional support structures like stakes or trellises to keep them upright.
* Don't forget to check the soil moisture levels regularly, as the mild weather might encourage your plants to grow more quickly.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to enjoying a bountiful harvest in your beautiful Porvoo garden!
