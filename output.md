## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:** With a humidity level of 89%, it's essential to avoid overwatering. However, since the temperature is around 12-15°C (54-59°F), your plants might appreciate some gentle watering. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering and adjust accordingly.

**Shades:** With few clouds in the sky, direct sunlight will be more intense than usual. Consider providing shades for sensitive plants or areas that receive direct sunlight for extended periods. You can use natural shades like trees or shrubs or install artificial shades if needed.

**Planting Today:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of crops in Porvoo. With the current weather conditions, you can consider planting:

* Cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale
* Root vegetables like carrots, beets, and potatoes
* Herbs like parsley, dill, and chives

Make sure to check the specific growing requirements for each plant and adjust your planting schedule accordingly.

**Other Tips:**

* Mulch can help retain moisture in the soil and regulate soil temperature. Apply a thin layer of organic mulch around your plants.
* Fertilize your plants with a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) to promote healthy growth.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which can thrive in warm weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.

Remember to check the weather forecast regularly and adjust your gardening routine accordingly. Happy gardening in Porvoo!
