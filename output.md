## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! With a clear sky and mild temperatures, it's an ideal time to get your garden ready for the growing season. Here are some expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast:

**Watering:**
Given the high humidity (92%), you might not need to water your plants today. However, if your soil feels dry to the touch or you have plants that require consistent moisture, go ahead and give them a good soaking.

**Shades:**
Since it's going to be a sunny day, consider providing shades for your plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use umbrellas, shade cloths, or even create natural shades using taller plants or shrubs.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. The soil has warmed up enough to support their growth, and the risk of frost has diminished significantly. You can also start planting herbs like basil, mint, and chives. For flowers, consider planting annuals like marigolds, zinnias, or sunflowers.

**Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** Take advantage of today's dry spell to work on your soil. Add organic matter like compost or manure to improve its structure and fertility.
2. **Pruning:** Use the sunny weather to prune your plants, especially shrubs and trees that need a little shaping or thinning.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or slugs, which can thrive in warm, humid conditions. Use natural methods like neem oil or hand-picking to control infestations.

**Additional Tips:**
As the temperature is expected to rise slightly by afternoon (14.32°C), make sure your plants are well-watered and receive adequate air circulation to prevent heat stress.

That's it for today! Enjoy your gardening time in Porvoo, and happy growing!
