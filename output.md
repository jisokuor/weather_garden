## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Dear gardener! It's a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland, with a temperature of 24.26°C and few clouds. The humidity is moderate at 50%, and the wind speed is gentle at 3.41 m/s.

Here are some expert gardening tips and recommendations for today:

**Watering:** Since the temperature is relatively high, it's essential to ensure your plants receive sufficient moisture. Water them thoroughly in the morning or early afternoon when the sun isn't too intense. Make sure the soil has a chance to dry slightly before watering again to prevent root rot.

**Shading:** With the sun shining brightly, consider setting up shades for sensitive plants or those that prefer partial shade. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial ones made of fabric or metal.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. The soil has warmed up, and the risk of frost has passed. Make sure to choose varieties suitable for your region and provide adequate support structures for climbing plants.

**Other tips:**

* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
* Deadhead flowers to encourage more blooming and promote healthy plant growth.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which might be attracted to the warm weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.

As you tend to your garden, remember to take breaks in the shade if needed, and don't forget to enjoy the beauty of nature surrounding you!
