## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Dear gardener! It's a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland. As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.

**Watering:**
Given the humidity level is 92%, it's essential to avoid overwatering your plants. Instead, focus on providing them with gentle misting or a light watering session in the morning to help them thrive. This will also encourage healthy growth and prevent fungal diseases.

**Shading:**
With clear skies and moderate temperatures (12.43°C), you can enjoy direct sunlight for most of the day. However, if you have plants that require partial shading, consider using shade cloth or placing them under a tree to avoid scorching.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and radishes, as well as flowers like marigolds, zinnias, and sunflowers. Take advantage of the mild weather and soil temperatures (around 10°C) to get your plants off to a strong start.

**Tips:**

1. **Mulch:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. **Fertilize:** Feed your plants with a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) to promote healthy growth and development.
3. **Prune:** Prune any dead or damaged branches from your trees and shrubs to maintain their shape and encourage new growth.
4. **Soil preparation:** As the soil starts to warm up, prepare it for planting by loosening the top 6-8 inches with a garden fork or spade.

Remember to keep an eye on the wind speed (1.81 m/s), which is relatively calm today. This will help prevent any potential damage to your plants or outdoor furniture.

As you tend to your garden, enjoy the beautiful day in Porvoo!
