**Watering:**
Considering the warm temperature (23.18°C) and moderate humidity (62%), it's essential to water your plants thoroughly today. Make sure to water them in the early morning or evening when the sun isn't too intense. Avoid watering during peak sun hours to prevent scorching or fungal growth.

With few clouds and a sunny day, consider setting up shades for your plants that receive direct sunlight. This will help prevent overheating and reduce transpiration. You can use natural shades like leaves or branches or create artificial ones using materials like cloth or paper.

May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops in Porvoo. Consider planting vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and okra. These will thrive in the current weather conditions and can be harvested in a few weeks. You can also plant herbs like basil, oregano, and thyme.

1. **Mulching:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch to your plants' soil to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate temperature.
2. **Pruning:** Use today's sunny weather to prune any overgrown branches or leaves on your plants. This will promote healthy growth and encourage fruiting or flowering.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. If you notice any infestations, treat your plants promptly to prevent damage.
