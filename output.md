## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

Considering the weather data, here are my suggestions:

**Watering:** Since it's mostly cloudy with a few clouds, the sun isn't shining brightly. This means your plants might not require as much water as they would on a sunny day. However, the humidity is at 80%, which is quite high. I recommend watering your plants lightly to ensure they don't dry out too quickly. A gentle soaking once or twice today should be sufficient.

**Shading:** With the cloudy weather, you might not need to provide additional shading for your plants. But if you have plants that are sensitive to wind or require a bit of protection, consider setting up some temporary shades using umbrellas, canopies, or even old sheets. The gentle breeze at 1.48 m/s shouldn't cause any issues.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant many types of flowers and vegetables in Porvoo. Today's weather is perfect for planting seeds like carrots, beets, and radishes. You can also start transplanting seedlings for tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. If you have a greenhouse or indoor space, consider starting some plants that require warmer temperatures.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Check your soil moisture:** Before planting, make sure the soil isn't too dry or waterlogged. The humidity might be high, but it's still essential to check the soil condition.
2. **Use mulch wisely:** Since the weather is cloudy, you might not need to apply as much mulch as you would on a sunny day. However, some plants like strawberries and lettuce benefit from a light layer of mulch to retain moisture.
3. **Keep an eye out for pests:** The humidity can attract pests like aphids or slugs. Regularly inspect your plants and take action if necessary.

In conclusion, today's weather in Porvoo is quite pleasant for gardening. With these tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in the heart of Finland!
