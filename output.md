## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Temperature:** With a pleasant temperature of 23.18°C (73.72°F), it's an ideal day to spend time outdoors, tending to your garden.

**Weather conditions:** Few clouds mean plenty of sunshine, making it perfect for planting and maintaining your garden.

**Wind speed:** A gentle breeze of 3.41 m/s (7.6 mph) will help circulate air and reduce the risk of fungal diseases in your plants.

**Humidity:** With a relatively low humidity level of 62%, you won't need to worry about excessive moisture affecting your plants' growth.

Considering it's May, I recommend taking advantage of the mild weather to:

1. **Water wisely:** Since the soil is still drying out from spring's thawing, water your plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.
2. **Set shades:** As the sun can be intense, consider setting up shade cloths or using natural shading methods (like planting taller plants nearby) to protect sensitive leaves and stems.
3. **Plant today!** May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. Make sure to choose varieties suitable for your region's short growing season.
4. **Prune with care:** Use the gentle breeze to gently prune or train vining plants, promoting healthy growth and air circulation.
5. **Monitor for pests:** Keep an eye out for early signs of pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which can thrive in warm, dry conditions.

By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in Porvoo's lovely spring weather!
