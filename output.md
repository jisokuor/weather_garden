## Dynamic Gardening Tips
The lovely weather in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:** With a temperature of 25.14°C (77.23°F) and humidity at 44%, it's an ideal day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, but if needed, go ahead and give them a good soaking. This will help the roots absorb the nutrients and support healthy growth.

**Shades:** With few clouds in the sky, you might not need shades today. However, it's always a good idea to have some shading options available for plants that require shade or prefer partial sun.

**Planting:** May is an excellent month to plant a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables in Porvoo. Consider planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, or peas, which thrive in the mild temperatures. You can also plant perennials like lavender, rosemary, or thyme, which will benefit from the sunny weather.

**Additional Tips:**

* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (3.41 m/s) to dry out any excess moisture on your plants' leaves and stems.
* With low humidity, you might not need to worry about fungal diseases as much. However, it's still essential to keep an eye out for pests like aphids or spider mites.
* If you have plants that prefer more intense sunlight, consider moving them to a sunnier spot today.

Enjoy the lovely weather in Porvoo, and happy gardening!
