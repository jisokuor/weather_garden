**Watering:**
With humidity at 89%, it's essential to ensure your plants receive the right amount of moisture. Water them thoroughly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot and other issues. Check the soil moisture by inserting your finger into the top inch of soil. If it feels dry, it's time for a drink.

**Shades:**
As the sun is shining, consider providing some shade for plants that might be sensitive to direct sunlight. This will help prevent scorching or discoloration. You can use natural shades like trees, shrubs, or even create artificial ones using shade cloths or trellises.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent month to plant a variety of spring flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo's climate. Some great options include:

* Spring bulbs like tulips, daffodils, or hyacinths
* Salad greens like lettuce, spinach, or arugula
* Herbs like mint, basil, or parsley
* Flowering annuals like petunias, marigolds, or pansies

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** With the soil temperature gradually rising, it's a great time to prepare your beds for planting. Mix in some organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve drainage and structure.
2. **Pruning:** As plants start to grow, prune them gently to promote healthy growth and encourage more blooms. This is particularly important for shrubs and perennials that need regular maintenance.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for common spring pests like aphids, slugs, or snails. Use natural methods like neem oil, garlic sprays, or copper tape to control infestations.
4. **Companion Planting:** Pair plants with complementary growing habits and characteristics. For example, plant marigolds with tomatoes to repel nematodes, or pair basil with tomatoes for a flavorful boost.
