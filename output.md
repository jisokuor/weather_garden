## Gardening Tips
Based on the weather forecast for Porvoo, Finland on May 16th, I'll provide expert gardening tips and recommendations for today. Since we're in the middle of May, it's still springtime in Finland, and the weather is quite changeable.

**Watering:**
Considering the temperature range (24°C to 14°C) and humidity levels (27% to 53%), I recommend watering your plants moderately today. The morning dew will help with some of the moisture needs, but a gentle sprinkling or soaker hose should be sufficient for most plants.

**Shades:**
As the sun is expected to set relatively early in the evening, consider providing shade for sensitive plants like ferns, impatiens, or begonias. You can use a DIY trellis, stakes, or even repurpose old umbrellas to create a shaded area.

**What to plant today:**
For a spring garden in Finland, I suggest planting cool-season crops that thrive in temperatures around 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F). Some suitable options include:

1. Lettuce and other leafy greens
2. Radishes
3. Spinach
4. Peas
5. Carrots

If you have a greenhouse or indoor space, you can also consider planting warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, or cucumbers, which will benefit from the warmer temperatures.

**Other useful hints and tips:**

1. ** Mulching:** As the soil temperature drops in the evening, mulch around your plants to retain warmth and moisture.
2. **Supports:** Install supports for climbing plants like peas, beans, or tomatoes as they start to grow.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for early pests like aphids, whiteflies, or slugs, which can be more active in the morning and evening when temperatures are cooler.

Remember to check the specific weather forecast for your area before planting, and adjust your gardening plans accordingly. Happy gardening!
