## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the weather data, here's what you can expect:

**Weather Conditions:** Clear sky with a temperature range of 13.8°C (May 31st) to 20.87°C (June 1st). The humidity will be relatively high at 91% during the morning hours and gradually decrease throughout the day.

**Watering Tips:**

* Water your plants thoroughly in the morning, as the soil may have dried out slightly due to the low humidity.
* Avoid watering during the peak sun hours (around 10 am) when the temperature will be higher, as this can cause fungal diseases to develop.
* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.

**Shade Recommendations:**

* Provide shade for sensitive plants or seedlings that may not tolerate direct sunlight. You can use makeshift shades made from cardboard boxes or cloth canopies.
* Consider transplanting heat-loving plants like tomatoes, peppers, or cucumbers outside once the weather warms up.

**Planting Suggestions:**

* May is a great time to plant cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and spinach. The mild temperatures will encourage healthy growth.
* For warmer climates, you can start planting warm-season crops like beans, corn, and squash.
* Don't forget to harden off your seedlings before transplanting them outside.

**Additional Tips:**

* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which may be more active in the warmer weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
* Take advantage of the clear sky and enjoy some gardening time! Make sure to wear protective clothing, including a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.
