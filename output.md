## Gardening Tips
The lovely month of May in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm happy to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.

**Current Weather Situation:**
As we can see from the weather data, it's a cloudy day with scattered clouds and a gentle breeze. The temperature is mild, ranging from 15°C (59°F) in the morning to 12°C (54°F) in the evening. The humidity is relatively high at around 70%.

**Watering:**
Given the cloudy conditions, I recommend watering your plants moderately today. Make sure to check the soil moisture before and after watering, as the clouds might not provide enough direct sunlight for efficient evaporation.

**Shading:**
With the sun hidden behind the clouds, it's essential to provide shade for plants that require it. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial shades made of cloth, mesh, or even recycled materials.

**What to Plant Today:**
For today's weather conditions, I suggest planting vegetables and herbs that prefer cooler temperatures and cloudy skies. Some excellent options include:

1. Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale)
2. Radishes
3. Carrots
4. Peas
5. Herbs like mint, basil, or cilantro

**Additional Tips:**

* Mulch your soil to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.
* Avoid planting warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, or eggplants today, as they require direct sunlight for optimal growth.
* Keep an eye on your plants' watering needs, as the cloudy conditions might lead to slower evaporation.

**Sunrise and Sunset:**
Don't forget to enjoy the beautiful sunrises and sunsets in Porvoo! With the sunrise at 3:48 AM and sunset at 10:34 PM, you can plan your day accordingly.

By following these expert gardening tips, you'll be able to create a thriving garden despite today's cloudy weather. Happy gardening in Porvoo!
