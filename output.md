## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A lovely spring day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm happy to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:**
With a temperature of 13.06°C (May is still quite cool), it's essential to keep an eye on your plants' water needs. Since the humidity is relatively high at 92%, you might not need to water as much as you would during dryer periods. However, if you have plants that prefer moist soil, today would be a good day for a gentle watering.

**Shading:**
As the sun rises higher in the sky (around 6:00 AM), your plants might appreciate some shade, especially those with delicate leaves or sensitive to direct sunlight. Consider using shade cloths, umbrellas, or even cardboard boxes to filter the light.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to start planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas. These hardy veggies will thrive in the moderate temperatures and can be harvested in about 60-90 days. If you have a greenhouse or indoor space, now's the perfect time to start seedlings for later transplanting.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

* Take advantage of the clear sky today and give your plants some extra TLC (tender loving care). Prune, fertilize, or repot as needed.
* As the wind speed is relatively low at 1.81 m/s, it's a good day for gentle plant training or pruning.
* Keep an eye on those pesky aphids and other pests that might be more active in this weather.

Remember to check the forecast regularly, as May can still bring some unpredictable weather patterns. Happy gardening in Porvoo!
