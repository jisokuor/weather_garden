Greetings from the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo! As you can see, it's a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland. With temperatures ranging from 15.7°C to 21.53°C (59°F to 71°F), and few clouds in the sky, this is an excellent time to tend to your garden.

**Watering:**
With humidity at 80%, I recommend watering your plants today. The soil should be moist but not waterlogged. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering to avoid overwatering.

**Shading:**
Since it's a sunny day, consider providing shade for any plants that require it. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial shades if necessary.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant various crops in Porvoo. Consider planting vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers. These warm-season crops will thrive in the moderate temperatures. If you're looking for flowers, May is a great time to plant roses, petunias, and marigolds.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** Before planting, make sure your soil is well-draining and has the right pH level for the specific plants you're growing.
2. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible to maintain a healthy garden ecosystem.
3. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
4. **Gardening Safety:** Wear protective gear like gloves, sunglasses, and a hat when working in your garden to avoid potential injuries.
