## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Dear gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share with you my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the provided weather data, I'll offer advice on watering, setting shades, what to plant today, and other useful hints and tips.

**Watering:**
With a comfortable temperature of 24.26°C (75.7°F) and moderate humidity of 50%, it's an ideal day for your plants. Water them thoroughly in the morning, as the soil may be dry after the recent spell of good weather. Make sure to provide enough water without overwatering, which can lead to root rot.

**Shades:**
With few clouds and a gentle breeze (wind speed: 3.41 m/s), your plants will appreciate some shading to prevent scorching by direct sunlight. You may use shade cloth or create a simple DIY shade using cardboard or newspaper. This will help maintain a comfortable temperature for your plants.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo, with the soil warming up nicely. Today's weather conditions are perfect for planting warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. You can also consider planting cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, or radishes if you prefer a milder flavor.

**Other tips:**

* Mulch your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
* Check the soil pH regularly to ensure it's within the optimal range for your specific plants.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites. A gentle spray of water may be enough to deter them.

**Additional insights:**
As the Gardener of the Year in Porvoo, I recommend keeping an eye on the forecast for any potential changes in weather patterns. The month of May can be quite unpredictable, with temperature fluctuations and occasional rain showers. Stay flexible, and adjust your gardening routine accordingly.

I hope these expert tips help you create a thriving garden in Porvoo! Happy gardening!
