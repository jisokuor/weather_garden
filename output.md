## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the weather data you provided, here's my advice:

**Watering:**
Given the high humidity (93%) and relatively cool temperature (13.06°C), it's essential to water your plants carefully. Aim for gentle soaking rather than flooding, as this will help prevent root rot. Consider watering in the morning or early afternoon to allow the soil to dry slightly before nightfall.

**Shading:**
With a clear sky forecasted for most of the day, direct sunlight might be intense. If you have sensitive plants, consider providing shade using natural or artificial means (e.g., umbrellas, canopies, or shading screens). This will help prevent scorching and promote healthy growth.

**Planting Today:**
May is a great time to plant in Porvoo! The weather conditions are suitable for planting a variety of species. Consider planting:

1. Vegetables like lettuce, spinach, radishes, or peas that thrive in cooler temperatures.
2. Herbs such as mint, chamomile, or dill that enjoy the mild climate.
3. Flowers like pansies, violas, or snapdragons that can tolerate some sun and moderate temperatures.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Mulch**: Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, bark chips, or compost) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. **Soil Care**: As the soil is still relatively cool, it's essential to maintain its structure and fertility. Consider adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil health.
3. **Pest Management**: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails that might be active in the moist conditions. Use organic control methods whenever possible.

Remember to check the weather forecast regularly and adjust your gardening strategies accordingly. Happy gardening in Porvoo!
