## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the weather data provided, here's what I suggest:

**Watering:**
Given the humidity level of 91% and the clear sky conditions, it's essential to monitor your plants' moisture levels closely. Water them thoroughly if they seem dry, but avoid overwatering as this could lead to root rot or other issues.

**Shades:**
Since the temperature is around 13°C, you might want to provide some shade for sensitive plants, especially those that prefer warmer conditions. Consider using shade cloths or trellises to create a shaded area if necessary.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers and vegetables in Porvoo's climate. Some ideal options include:

* Cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas
* Spring-blooming bulbs like tulips and daffodils
* Perennials like roses, lavender, and herbs (like mint, chamomile, or thyme)

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

* Take advantage of the clear sky to get some direct sunlight on your plants. This can help with photosynthesis and overall plant health.
* Keep an eye out for any potential wind damage as the wind speed reaches 1.81 m/s. Secure any loose or tall plants, and consider using windbreaks if necessary.
* With the moderate humidity levels, it's a good idea to maintain a consistent watering schedule to ensure your plants receive the right amount of moisture.

Remember to monitor the weather forecast regularly for any changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind speed. This will help you make informed decisions about your gardening activities and ensure the best possible outcomes for your plants. Happy gardening!
