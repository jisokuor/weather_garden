## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm happy to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:** With a clear sky and a temperature of 13.8°C, it's a great day to water your plants! Since the humidity is high at 91%, make sure to water them thoroughly but not excessively. Check the soil moisture before watering, and avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.

**Shading:** With direct sunlight being minimal due to the clear sky, you can provide some shade for plants that need it. Use natural or artificial shading materials like mulch, straw, or even a shaded trellis to protect them from excessive heat.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant perennials and vegetables in Porvoo! Consider planting:

* Early-season crops like peas, spinach, and lettuce
* Perennials like strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries for later harvests

Keep in mind that the soil temperature might still be a bit cool (around 10°C), so choose plants that prefer cooler temperatures.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (1.81 m/s) to help pollinate your flowers or distribute seeds.
* Watch out for any strong gusts (up to 5.01 m/s) that might damage delicate plant structures or dislodge plants.
* With a visibility of 10,000 meters, it's an excellent day for spotting any pests or diseases on your plants.
