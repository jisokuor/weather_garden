## Gardening Tips
The lovely city of Porvoo in Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations based on the weather data you've provided. Since we're in May, it's a great time to get your garden ready for the warmer months ahead.

**Watering:**
Given the moderate temperatures (around 16°C) and humidity levels (83-80%), it's essential to water your plants regularly, but not excessively. A general rule of thumb is to provide about 1-2 inches of water per week, either from rain or irrigation. Make sure the soil has a chance to dry out slightly between watering sessions.

**Shade:**
With cloud cover ranging from overcast to broken clouds, it's crucial to consider providing shade for your plants, especially those sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shading methods like planting trees or using trellises with shade-providing materials. For today, you might want to provide some afternoon shade for your plants.

**What to Plant:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of vegetables, herbs, and flowers in Porvoo. Some great options include:

* Leafy greens like lettuce, spinach, and kale
* Radishes, carrots, and beets
* Herbs like chives, parsley, and dill
* Flowers like marigolds, zinnias, and sunflowers

**Other Useful Hints:**
1. **Soil preparation:** Before planting, make sure the soil is well-draining and has a pH level suitable for your chosen plants.
2. **Mulching:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (like straw or bark chips) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
3. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for common garden pests like aphids, slugs, and snails, and take action if necessary to prevent infestations.

**Additional Tips:**
1. Take advantage of the mild temperatures to prune or divide plants that need attention.
2. If you have any tender perennials (like roses or peonies), consider applying a layer of mulch around their bases to protect them from frost.
3. As we're approaching the summer solstice, be mindful of your garden's sunlight exposure and adjust your plantings accordingly.

I hope these gardening tips help you create a beautiful and thriving garden in Porvoo!
