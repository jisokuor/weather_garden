## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:**
With a temperature of 13.8°C (55.6°F) and humidity at 91%, it's essential to ensure your plants receive adequate moisture. Today, I recommend watering your plants thoroughly, especially those that require more moisture, such as flowering plants or vegetables. However, be cautious not to overwater, as the soil may retain excess water due to the high humidity.

**Shade:**
With clear skies and gentle winds (1.81 m/s), your plants will appreciate some shade during the peak sun hours (around 11 am). Consider placing shading materials like row covers or even old sheets to protect sensitive leaves from direct sunlight.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of crops in Porvoo, including:

1. **Vegetables:** Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and lettuce can thrive in this mild weather.
2. **Flowers:** Petunias, marigolds, and pansies will enjoy the sunshine and gentle breeze.
3. **Herbs:** Basil, mint, and cilantro are perfect for planting today.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** As the soil is still quite cold, it's essential to loosen the top 6-8 inches of soil with a fork or tiller before planting.
2. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any overgrown plants, like roses or shrubs, to encourage new growth and promote air circulation.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which might be attracted to the moist soil and warm temperatures.

**Weather Forecast:**
As the day progresses, the temperature will rise slightly, reaching 14.69°C (58.4°F) by 3 pm. The winds will pick up slightly, but it's still a pleasant day for gardening in Porvoo!

Remember to dress warmly, wear comfortable shoes, and enjoy your time in the garden!
