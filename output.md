## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'll provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on the current weather forecast.

**Watering:** Given that it's going to be a relatively warm day (up to 22°C/72°F), make sure to water your plants well in the morning. The soil may dry out slightly by mid-day, so keep an eye on your plants' moisture levels and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.

**Shades:** With cloudy conditions forecasted for most of the day, there's no need to worry about intense sunlight burning your plants. However, if you have plants that prefer partial shade, now is a great time to provide them with some protection using shades or trellises.

**Planting:** Today's suitable temperatures and gentle winds make it an excellent day to plant cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas. These crops will thrive in the current conditions and can be harvested within a few weeks. Don't forget to harden off your seedlings before transplanting them outside!

**Other tips:**

* Take advantage of the cloudy skies to prune or train your plants without worrying about intense sunlight.
* If you have any outdoor decorations, consider bringing them indoors today to prevent damage from potential wind gusts.
* Keep an eye on your soil moisture levels and adjust your watering schedule accordingly. You don't want your plants to dry out too quickly.

By following these expert gardening tips, you'll be well on your way to growing a beautiful and thriving garden in Porvoo!
