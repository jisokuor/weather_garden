## Gardening Tips
May 22nd, 2024, in Porvoo, Finland - a lovely day indeed! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm excited to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:** With a clear sky and gentle breeze, it's an excellent opportunity to water your plants. The temperature is quite pleasant, ranging from 19.35°C to 19.82°C, which means most plants will appreciate the moisture. Water your plants thoroughly, but avoid overwatering, as the soil may still be a bit cool.

**Shade:** Given the warm temperatures and gentle breeze, it's essential to provide some shade for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial shades if needed.

**Planting:** May 22nd is an excellent time to plant vegetables like carrots, beans, and peas in Porvoo. The soil temperature is suitable for most cool-season crops. For flowering plants, you can plant marigolds, nasturtiums, or pansies, which will bloom beautifully with the gentle sunlight.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** Before planting, make sure to loosen the top 10-15 cm of soil to allow for good root growth.
2. **Mulching:** Apply a thin layer of organic mulch (like straw or grass clippings) around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
3. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any leggy perennials, like lavender or rosemary, to encourage bushy growth.
4. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, which might be more active in the warm weather. Use natural pest control methods like neem oil or introduce beneficial insects to your garden.

**Finland-specific advice:**

1. **Be prepared for sudden changes:** In Finland's unpredictable climate, it's essential to have a backup plan in case of unexpected rain showers or strong winds.
2. **Use frost blankets:** If you're planning to plant warm-season crops later in the season, use frost blankets to protect them from potential late-spring frosts.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving and beautiful garden in Porvoo, Finland. Happy gardening!
