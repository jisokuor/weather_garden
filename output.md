## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm happy to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:**
With a temperature of 11.16°C and humidity levels at 95%, it's essential to ensure your plants are getting enough moisture. I recommend watering your plants in the morning or early evening when the sun is not too intense. Make sure to water them thoroughly but avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.

**Shade:**
Given the few clouds and moderate wind speed of 1.48 m/s, you may want to consider setting up some shade for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to direct sunlight or have delicate foliage. You can use shade cloth, umbrellas, or even create a DIY canopy using sticks and leaves.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant vegetables like lettuce, spinach, radishes, and peas in Porvoo. The mild temperature and high humidity will help them thrive. You can also start sowing flowers like marigolds, sunflowers, and zinnias for a pop of color in your garden.

**Other Hints and Tips:**

* Mulch your soil to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
* Prune any dead or damaged leaves or stems from your plants to promote healthy growth.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which can thrive in these conditions. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.

Remember to check the weather forecast regularly to adjust your gardening plan accordingly. Happy gardening!
