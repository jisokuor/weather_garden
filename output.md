## Dynamic Gardening Tips
What a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.

**Watering:**
Given the clear sky and relatively low humidity (92%), today is an excellent day to water your plants. However, due to the moderate wind speed (1.81 m/s), I suggest using a gentle watering technique to avoid washing away any beneficial soil microorganisms. Water your plants when the sun is not directly overhead to minimize evaporation.

**Shades:**
With the clear sky and warm temperatures expected later in the day, it's essential to provide some shade for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to direct sunlight. Consider using a shading material or placing a physical barrier (like a trellis or a canopy) to protect your plants from intense sun rays.

**What to Plant:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables in Porvoo's climate. Some great options for today include:

1. Perennials like lavender, rosemary, and thyme, which thrive in well-drained soil and can tolerate some direct sunlight.
2. Vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and radishes, which prefer cooler temperatures and can benefit from the gentle rain.
3. Annuals like marigolds, zinnias, and sunflowers, which love full sun and will add a pop of color to your garden.

**Other Useful Hints:**

1. Mulch around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. Prune any dead or damaged plant material to promote healthy growth and prevent the spread of disease.
3. Take advantage of the gentle breeze to pollinate flowers like apple blossoms or herbs like mint.

**Additional Tips:**

1. As the sun rises higher in the sky, be mindful of potential heat stress on your plants. Provide some shade if necessary.
2. Keep an eye out for any potential pests or diseases that might take advantage of the warm and sunny weather.
3. Enjoy the beautiful day and get outside to tend to your garden!

I hope these expert gardening tips and recommendations help you make the most of this lovely day in Porvoo, Finland!
