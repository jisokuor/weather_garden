## Dynamic Gardening Tips
The lovely month of May in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert tips and recommendations for today's gardening endeavors.

**Watering:** With a comfortable temperature of 15.7°C (60°F) and humidity level of 80%, it's an ideal day to water your plants. Make sure to provide them with enough moisture, especially if they're just starting to grow or need a boost after the winter. A gentle soaking will help keep the soil moist without causing any damage.

**Shading:** With few clouds in the sky and a moderate wind speed of 1.48 m/s (3.3 mph), your plants might appreciate some afternoon shading. Consider using shade cloths, umbrellas, or even natural shading from nearby trees to protect them from the direct sunlight.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant many species in Porvoo. With the soil warming up and the risk of frost decreasing, you can start planting:

* Vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and carrots
* Herbs like basil, mint, and chives
* Flower bulbs for a colorful display later in the year

**Additional Tips:**

* Mulch your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Organic mulches like straw or wood chips work well.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which can thrive in warm weather. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
* Consider dividing and replanting overgrown perennials to maintain their health and vigor.

**Weather Forecast:** As you plan your gardening activities, keep in mind that the weather is expected to remain pleasant throughout the day. Enjoy the sunshine and make the most of this beautiful May morning in Porvoo!
