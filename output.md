With a humidity level of 92%, the soil may be slightly moist, but still needs attention. Water your plants gently, as the soil is already quite saturated. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

As the sun will shine brightly today, consider providing some shade for sensitive plants or those that prefer partial shade. You can use temporary shades like umbrellas or even create a DIY trellis with a canopy.

* Radishes, beets, or carrots for a quick harvest

**Other tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the sunny weather to prune your plants, especially those that require regular pruning, like roses or lavender.
2. **Mulching:** Add a layer of organic mulch (like straw or wood chips) to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
3. **Compost:** Turn your compost pile regularly to ensure it's well-aerated and ready for use in the future.

A beautiful day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:**
With a temperature of 11.9째C and humidity at 92%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to provide them with a good soaking, but avoid overwatering, as the soil may still be cool from the morning dew.

**Shading:**
Since we have a clear sky (weather condition: "Clear"), there's no need for additional shading. However, if you're planning to work in your garden during the peak sun hours (usually between 10 am and 4 pm), consider using a hat or umbrella to protect yourself from the sun.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo. Considering today's weather, I recommend planting:

1. Cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and peas.
2. Flowers like pansies, violas, or sweet peas that thrive in the cooler temperatures.
3. Herbs like mint, thyme, or oregano that can tolerate partial shade.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** As the soil is still slightly cool from the morning dew, it's an ideal time to prepare your garden beds for planting. Remove any debris, and mix in some compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and fertility.
2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, and snails that might be active during this time of year. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or copper tape to protect your plants.
3. **Garden maintenance:** Take advantage of the clear weather to tidy up your garden beds, prune any dead foliage, and remove any weeds.

Remember to dress warmly and wear comfortable shoes as you tend to your garden today!
