## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.

**Temperature:** With a high of 23.61°C (74.54°F) and a low of 20.68°C (69.12°F), it's perfect for most plants to grow and thrive.

**Weather Conditions:** The overcast clouds will provide some shade, which is beneficial for plants that prefer partial shading or have sensitive leaves.

**Wind Speed:** A gentle breeze of 2.16 m/s (4.82 mph) won't cause significant damage to your plants.

**Humidity:** With a relative humidity of 80%, it's ideal for most plants to absorb moisture through their leaves.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Watering:** Since the soil may be drying out slightly due to the overcast conditions, consider watering your plants in the morning or late afternoon when the sun is not directly hitting them.
2. **Shades:** Take advantage of the natural shade provided by the clouds and consider placing shades on your plants that prefer partial shading, such as ferns or hostas.
3. **Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and squash in Porvoo. The mild temperatures and moderate humidity will help them establish a strong root system. You can also start planting annuals like marigolds, zinnias, and cosmos for a pop of color.
4. **Pruning:** Take this opportunity to prune any leggy plants or deadheading spent blooms to encourage bushy growth and promote healthy plant development.

**Additional Tips:**

1. Monitor the soil moisture levels regularly to avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.
2. Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.
3. Keep an eye out for pests like aphids or whiteflies, as they may be attracted to the sweet nectar produced by flowering plants.

As you tend to your garden today in Porvoo, remember to take it easy, enjoy the gentle breeze, and appreciate the beauty of nature. Happy gardening!
