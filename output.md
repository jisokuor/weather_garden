## Dynamic Gardening Tips
What a lovely day it is in Porvoo! With the temperature reaching 25.1Â°C and only few clouds in the sky, it's perfect weather for gardening.

**Watering:**
Considering the humidity level of 50%, I recommend watering your plants lightly to avoid overwatering. The soil should be moist but not waterlogged. You can also use this opportunity to repot any plants that need fresh soil or more space to grow.

**Shades:**
With the sun shining brightly, it's essential to provide shades for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shades like trees, shrubs, or even create a DIY shade structure using umbrellas or fabric. This will help prevent scorching and ensure your plants receive the right amount of light.

**What to Plant:**
May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops in Porvoo! Consider planting tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and squash. These plants love the warmth and sunlight, which will be abundant today. Make sure to choose varieties that are resistant to common pests and diseases in your region.

**Other Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** As the soil is still warming up, it's an excellent time to prepare it for planting. Remove any debris, till the soil to a depth of about 10-12 inches, and mix in some organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure.

2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that can thrive in warm weather. Use natural pest control methods like neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introduce beneficial insects to your garden.

3. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw, bark chips, or newspaper) around 2-3 inches thick to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

4. **Pruning:** Take the opportunity to prune any plants that need it. Pruning helps promote healthy growth, increases air circulation, and encourages fruiting.

5. **Companion planting:** Plant complementary vegetables like marigolds with tomatoes (to repel nematodes) or basil with peppers (to improve flavor). This will enhance your garden's overall health and productivity.
