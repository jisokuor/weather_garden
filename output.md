## Dynamic Gardening Tips
What a lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert gardening tips and recommendations with you.

**Watering:**
Considering the overcast clouds and humidity levels (75%), it's an excellent idea to water your plants today. The temperature is quite comfortable at 21.25°C, making it perfect for most plant species. Make sure to provide enough moisture, but not so much that it could lead to root rot.

**Shades:**
With the overcast skies, you might not need to worry too much about providing shades for your plants. However, if you have plants that prefer partial shade or are sensitive to direct sunlight, consider using a sheer curtain or a shade cloth to filter the light.

**What to plant today:**
May is an excellent time to start planting in Porvoo! Take advantage of the mild weather and soil temperature (around 15°C) by sowing seeds for:

1. Vegetables like lettuce, radishes, carrots, and beans.
2. Herbs such as cilantro, parsley, and dill.
3. Flowers like pansies, violas, and sweet peas.

**Other useful hints and tips:**

* With the wind speed at 2.16 m/s, make sure to secure any loose plant material or debris that could be blown away.
* Take advantage of the gentle breeze to pollinate your plants, such as by gently shaking flowers to encourage bees and other beneficial insects.
* As the soil is still relatively cool, it's an excellent time to plant bulbs like tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths for a beautiful spring display next year.

**Month-specific tips:**
May is a great time to start preparing your garden for the warmer months ahead. Consider adding organic matter to your soil to improve its structure and fertility. This will help support healthy plant growth and development throughout the season.
