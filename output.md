## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast in Porvoo, Finland.

**Watering:**
With a pleasant temperature of 23.64°C (74.53°F) and moderate humidity of 42%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. However, considering the scattered clouds and gentle breeze, I recommend watering them lightly to avoid overwatering. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as some plants might require more attention than others.

**Shades:**
As the sun will be shining brightly throughout the day, consider providing shades for sensitive plants or those that tend to get scorched by direct sunlight. You can use umbrellas, shade cloth, or even create your own DIY shades using sticks and leaves.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables in Porvoo. With the current weather conditions, I recommend planting:

* Flowers like marigolds, zinnias, or sunflowers that thrive in full sun.
* Herbs like basil, mint, or chamomile that love warm temperatures and moderate humidity.
* Vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, or carrots that can tolerate partial shade.

**Additional Tips:**

* Take advantage of the gentle breeze to gently stir your compost pile or aerate your soil to improve drainage.
* Mulch around your plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
* Keep an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases, as the warm weather can bring them out in force.

As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I hope these tips help you make the most of today's beautiful weather. Happy gardening!
