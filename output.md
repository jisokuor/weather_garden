## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A beautiful clear sky day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm excited to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today.

**Watering:**
With a temperature of 13.06°C and humidity at 92%, it's a great idea to water your plants this morning. However, due to the clear sky and low wind speed (1.81 m/s), I recommend watering them lightly to avoid overwatering. Your plants will appreciate the gentle hydration.

**Shades:**
As the sun rises higher in the sky, you might want to consider providing some shade for your plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shades like trees or bushes or even install temporary shades made of cloth or paper.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is a great time to plant a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables in Porvoo's mild climate. Consider planting:

1. Flowers: Petunias, marigolds, and sunflowers are excellent choices for this time of year.
2. Herbs: Basil, mint, and chives will thrive in the warm weather.
3. Vegetables: Tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots can be planted in your garden.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** Before planting, make sure to prepare your soil by loosening it up with a fork or spade. This will help improve drainage and air circulation.
2. **Companion Planting:** Plant companions like nasturtiums with tomatoes to attract beneficial insects and deter pests.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, whiteflies, and slugs, which can be attracted to the warm weather. Use natural pest control methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap if necessary.

**Additional Tips:**

1. Take advantage of the clear sky and sunny weather to prune your plants, inspect for pests, or perform other maintenance tasks.
2. If you have a garden bed that receives full sun, consider adding a layer of mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
