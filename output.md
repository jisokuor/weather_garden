## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Given the pleasant weather conditions, here's what I suggest:

**Watering:** With temperatures reaching 25.14°C and humidity at 44%, it's an excellent day to water your plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture by inserting a finger into the soil up to the second knuckle. If the top inch of soil feels dry, it's time to water. Aim for about 1-2 inches of water per week, depending on the type of plants you have.

**Shades:** With few clouds in the sky, your plants will appreciate some shade protection during the hottest part of the day (usually between 11 am and 3 pm). You can use shading materials like burlap, cheesecloth, or even a makeshift trellis to provide filtered sunlight.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and okra. These plants thrive in temperatures above 20°C (68°F). You can also consider planting herbs like basil, mint, and lemongrass, which love the warmth and humidity.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw or wood chips) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
2. **Fertilizing:** Feed your plants with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth. For most vegetables and flowers, a 10-10-10 NPK ratio is suitable.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, whiteflies, and slugs. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible, such as neem oil or soap-based sprays.
4. **Companion Planting:** Consider planting complementary plants together to enhance growth, flavor, and pest resistance. For example, plant marigolds with tomatoes to repel nematodes.

**Additional Tips for the Month of May:**

1. **Soil Preparation:** As the soil warms up, it's an excellent time to till or aerate your garden beds to improve drainage and air circulation.
2. **Pruning:** Prune any deadheading flowers to encourage blooming and prevent seed production.
