## Dynamic Gardening Tips
A lovely day in Porvoo, Finland! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations based on today's weather forecast.

**Watering:** With a humidity level of 95% and temperatures ranging from 11.16°C to 20.02°C, it's essential to water your plants carefully. Aim for about an hour-long watering session in the morning or early evening to avoid wasting water. Make sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.

**Shades:** Since we have few clouds with scattered cloudiness throughout the day, you may want to consider providing some shade for your plants, especially those that are sensitive to direct sunlight. This will help prevent scorching and promote healthy growth.

**What to Plant Today:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of flowers, vegetables, and herbs in Porvoo. Consider planting hardy annuals like pansies, violas, or snapdragons, which thrive in cooler temperatures and partial shade. You can also start seedlings for tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers.

**Other Useful Hints and Tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Take advantage of the mild weather to prune your roses, apple trees, and other fruit-bearing plants.
2. **Composting:** Add some compost to your soil to improve its structure and fertility. This will help support healthy plant growth throughout the season.
3. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails, which may be more active in these mild temperatures.
4. **Mulching:** Mulch around your plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

Remember to check the weather forecast regularly to adjust your gardening activities accordingly. Happy gardening in Porvoo!
