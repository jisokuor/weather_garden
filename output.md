## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Considering the weather data, here are some valuable insights:

**Watering:**
With a humidity level of 91% and no rain forecasted, it's essential to water your plants thoroughly but not excessively. Check the soil moisture by inserting your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, give your plants a good soaking.

**Setting Shades:**
The temperature is around 13.8°C (56.6°F), which is quite pleasant for outdoor gardening. However, with the sun shining brightly, it's crucial to provide shade for sensitive plants or those that prefer partial shade. You can use natural shades like trees or install artificial ones like umbrellas or canopies.

**What to Plant Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant a variety of crops in Porvoo! With the moderate temperature and humidity, you can sow:

1. Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale) for a continuous harvest.
2. Tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.
3. Radishes, carrots, and beets, which can tolerate some shade.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Pruning:** Use this opportunity to prune your roses, shrubs, or trees to maintain their shape and promote healthy growth.
2. **Weeding:** Remove any weeds that have emerged during the spring season to prevent them from competing with your desired plants for water and nutrients.
3. **Fertilizing:** Consider applying a balanced fertilizer to your plants, as they'll benefit from the extra nourishment.
4. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, or snails that might take advantage of the warm weather. Use organic methods to control infestations.

As the sun rises higher in the sky, remember to monitor your plants' responses and adjust your gardening strategy accordingly. Happy gardening in Porvoo!
