## Dynamic Gardening Tips
Dear gardener of the Year of Porvoo! Based on the provided weather data, I shall offer expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Here's what I've got for you:

**Watering:**
With a temperature of 25.67°C and humidity at 28%, it's essential to water your plants carefully. Water them thoroughly in the morning, allowing the soil to dry slightly before watering again in the afternoon if necessary. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot and other issues.

**Shade:**
Since the weather is mostly sunny with scattered clouds, it's a good idea to provide shade for your plants during the hottest part of the day (around 15:00-17:00). This will help prevent scorching or overheating. You can use shade cloth, umbrellas, or even build a simple trellis with a canopy.

**Planting Today:**
May is an excellent time to plant many types of vegetables and flowers in Porvoo. Consider planting cool-season crops like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and peas. For warmer weather, you can plant tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and herbs like basil and mint.

**Tips and Hints:**

1. **Take advantage of the wind:** With a gentle breeze (3.82 m/s), use it to your advantage by planting rows of vegetables or flowers in a way that allows for good air circulation. This can help prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.
2. **Prepare for cooler evenings:** As the sun sets, temperatures will drop significantly. Be prepared to bring plants indoors or provide additional protection (like row covers) if you're concerned about frost.
3. **Don't forget about pests:** Although it's still early in the season, keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, slugs, and snails. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
