## Dynamic Gardening Tips
As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland. Based on the weather data, here's what I suggest:

**Watering:** With a relative humidity of 91% and a clear sky, it's essential to water your plants thoroughly but not excessively. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. For most plants, an occasional light watering will suffice.

**Shading:** With temperatures ranging from 13.8°C to 20.87°C (56°F-69°F), you might want to provide some shading for your plants, especially those that prefer partial shade or are sensitive to direct sunlight. You can use natural shading methods like planting taller plants nearby or using physical shades.

**Planting:** May is an excellent time to plant a variety of vegetables and flowers in Porvoo. Take advantage of the mild temperatures and clear skies to sow seeds for:

1. Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale)
2. Radishes
3. Carrots
4. Beans
5. Peas
6. Herbs like basil, mint, and cilantro

**Tips and Hints:**

* Mulch your soil to retain moisture and regulate the temperature.
* Fertilize your plants with a balanced fertilizer for optimal growth.
* Prune or deadhead flowers regularly to encourage blooming and prevent seed production.
* Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and slugs, which can thrive in humid conditions.
