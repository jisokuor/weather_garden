A lovely spring day in Porvoo! As the Gardener of the Year, I'm delighted to share my expert advice with you.

**Watering:**
With a comfortable temperature and humidity level, today is an excellent day to water your plants. However, considering the wind speed is relatively low (3.02 m/s), you might want to avoid overwatering to prevent fungal diseases or root rot. Water your plants deeply but thoroughly, making sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.

**Shades:**
As the sun is shining through scattered clouds, providing some shade for sensitive plants will be beneficial. If you have plants that require partial shading, consider using a trellis, arbor, or even a simple DIY shade structure to protect them from direct sunlight.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent month to plant in Porvoo! With the soil still slightly cool and the air mild, it's perfect for sowing seeds of:

* Tomatoes
* Peppers
* Cucumbers
* Zucchini
* Carrots
* Radishes

These vegetables will thrive in the gentle spring weather. Don't forget to check the specific planting instructions for each variety.

**Additional Tips:**

* As the temperature is still relatively cool, you might want to wait a few days before planting warm-season crops like beans or corn.
* With 87% humidity, make sure your plants have good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Consider pruning any overgrown foliage or installing fans in your garden.
* Take advantage of the pleasant weather and perform some much-needed gardening tasks, such as weeding, mulching, or composting.

Remember to keep an eye on the temperature and adjust your watering schedule accordingly. Enjoy your beautiful spring day in Porvoo!
