As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to share some expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in Porvoo, Finland.

Considering the weather forecast and the fact that it's May, here are my suggestions:

**Watering:**
With a comfortable temperature of 23.18Â°C and moderate humidity of 62%, your plants will appreciate a good soaking today! Aim to provide about an inch (2-3 cm) of water for most plants. Make sure to check the soil moisture before watering, as some plants might require less or more water based on their specific needs.

**Shading:**
With few clouds in the sky, direct sunlight can be quite intense. Consider setting up shades or providing afternoon shading for sensitive plants like ferns, impatiens, or begonias. This will help prevent scorching and keep your plants happy.

**Planting Suggestions:**
May is an excellent time to plant warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and squash in Porvoo. The soil has warmed up, and the risk of frost has decreased significantly. If you're planning to grow cool-season crops, now's a good time to start sowing carrots, beans, or peas.

**Additional Tips:**

* Take advantage of the gentle breeze (3.41 m/s) by pruning trees or shrubs that need it.
* Check your soil pH and adjust accordingly if necessary. May is an excellent time for soil testing in Porvoo.
* Mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and specific plant requirements may vary. Always research the unique needs of each species before planting or caring for them.

Stay sunny (pun intended) and happy gardening in Porvoo!
