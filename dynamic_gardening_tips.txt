As the Gardener of the Year of Porvoo, I'm delighted to provide you with expert gardening tips and recommendations for today in May!

**Watering:**
Given the high humidity (93%) and moderate temperature (17.83Â°C), it's essential to maintain a consistent moisture level in your plants. Water your plants thoroughly in the morning, taking care not to overwater. You can also consider mulching or adding organic matter to improve soil structure.

**Shading:**
With scattered clouds, direct sunlight might be intense at times. Consider providing shade for sensitive plants or those that prefer partial shade. You can use natural shading methods like planting taller species nearby or installing a temporary shade cloth.

**Planting:**
May is an excellent time to plant in Porvoo! Take advantage of the mild weather and get started with:

1. **Flowers:** Plant annuals like marigolds, petunias, or snapdragons that thrive in moderate temperatures.
2. **Vegetables:** Sow seeds for tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and herbs like basil or mint.
3. **Fruits:** Start planting strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Soil preparation:** With high humidity, the soil might be prone to waterlogging. Ensure good drainage by adding organic matter or perlite.
2. **Pest control:** Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, and snails that thrive in humid environments. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.
3. **Fertilization:** Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) to promote healthy plant growth.
4. **Pruning:** Prune plants to maintain shape, encourage new growth, or remove dead foliage.

**Wind protection:**
The moderate wind speed (3.02 m/s) is relatively calm, but it's still essential to protect your more delicate plants from potential damage. Use stakes, trellises, or windbreaks as necessary.

By following these expert gardening tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden in Porvoo, Finland!
